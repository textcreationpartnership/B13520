            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Owe my selfe, and all I haue, vnto your Grace, much more my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, with the labour of my hands, head and heart, as most bounden. Though Truth need no Patron, being it selfe free, and that which freeth vs; protected by the God of truth, preached by him that is the Way, the Truth and the Life; published, preserued and inspired by that Comforter that is the Spirit of truth, and therefore is great, and must preuaile: yet do I betake my selfe and my slender endeuours to your Graces protection, as my chiefe Patron; leauing Gods truth, which I haue laboured to make manifest, to his owne gracious blessing, and the censure thereof to
<pb facs="tcp:177094:3"/> his most Christian, Catholique, and Apostolique Church.</p>
            <p>Your Grace did not onely by speech moue me to meditate vpon this subiect, but also gaue me great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to proceed, when I presented vnto you a few sheets of paper the next morning after your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a slender modell of one nights framing. Hereunto I was pricked forward by a godly emulation (and it is good to emulate the good euer, yea and not onely the good, but the euill also in that which is good, as by the example of the vniust steward appeares) partly toward those multitudes of Authors, sacred, profane, old, new, friends and foes, with whose works your Graces great and good Library is plentifully furnished; deeming it a shame to my selfe, being then threescore yeares old, to dye and sorrow like <hi>Callicrates,</hi> who as he gaue vp the ghost, said, <hi>My death grieueth me not, because I came out of my countrey to dye; but it grieueth me to dye before I giue a wound vnto mine enemie.</hi> So verily it grieueth me not to be old, or to dye; but it would grieue me to dye before I had wounded a head of that beast which persecuteth the Saints of God. Wherefore seeing so many haue written great and tedious volumes against the truth, I would not passe like an arrow in the ayre, or a ship in the sea, and leaue no monument behind me, <hi>to put my flocke in mind of those things which I would wish to be beleeued after my departure;</hi> as well by my pen, which may haply pierce when I am dead, as by my tongue, which shall not ceasse (if it please God) to preach while I liue: and God knoweth I desire to liue no longer. Yea and not without some emulation of your Graces selfe, whom I continually obserue to be
<pb facs="tcp:177094:3"/> as painfull in your studies, as diligent in your prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; as actiue in your gouernment, as affable in your entertainment; as iudicious in the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all authors as euer: which I haue not onely considered with due admiration, but also bene emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to follow and imitate such a guide, and so good, <hi>quamuis non passibus aequis.</hi> These haue bene my motiues. Such as my poore labours are, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to your Graces feete, as a part of that dutie which I owe for the great bountie of your more then liberalitie and continuall fauour extended to me and mine. Which if they shall be vouchsafed your father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acceptance, I shall solace my selfe as <hi>Antima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> did, when all his auditors failed saue onely <hi>Plato: Legam nihilominùs: Plato enim vnus mihi instar omnium est.</hi> So if all my readers should faile me but your Grace, I would notwithstanding write; for your Grace vnto me is in stead of all, seeing you haue already stood me in more stead then all. If these obligations of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert and worth, were either by my negligence forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, or by mine vnthankfulnesse misprised; yet the very subiect matter of my book would challenge it for your Grace before any other, and as soone from me as from any other.</p>
            <p>For I writing of <hi>Antiquitie</hi> in mine old age, to whom should I commit it (for I cannot commend it) but to an Ancient in Gods Israel, who is the staffe and stay of my declining dayes? And seeing I hold, that the most <hi>Ancient Religion is the best,</hi> why should I not offer it to the most ancient Doctor of Diuinitie that I heare of in this land, and the most ancient Bishop, both for age and consecration, that I know in our Church? who hath
<pb facs="tcp:177094:4"/> not onely read all the <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> with a diligent eye, but hath also noted them with a iudicious pen (as mine owne eyes are witnesses, and God reward you for such my libertie) and made continuall vse of them in his Sermons, as any ancient Father in our nation, shall I say? yea in all Christendome, as I dare say, and verily do beleeue: which our aduersaries howsoeuer they did enuie it, yet in their conscience could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore as <hi>Cicero</hi> wrote his booke <hi>De Senectute, in senectute;</hi> made noble <hi>Cato Maior</hi> his obiect, as the best patterne whereto he might conforme his proiect; and commended it to <hi>Pomponius Atticus</hi> an old man, as the worthiest Patron of such a subiect: So my poore selfe, in these mine old yeares (hauing entred my Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mactericke) for the comfort of mine age, haue pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this little passage of the oldest Religion, and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen your Grace as the fittest and most worthie Patron thereof. Not to be tedious or troublesome to your Grace any farther, I will beg leaue (which your Grace will vouchsafe) to vsurpe in the conclusion of mine Epistle, that which your old friend and familiar vsed as the Preface of his booke:<note place="margin">Cicero de Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectute.</note>

What I haue, or shall attaine vnto, standeth and resteth vpon Gods blessing, and the Christian Catholique Churches censure. My hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest prayer to God is, that my heart and worke may be acceptable in his sight, and profitable to his Church. My tender suite vnto this Church, is, that my paines may rest approued vnto each honest heart; or that I may receiue brotherly admonition from the learned, for any thing in it which is amisse. As for them that are without, I say, <hi>Parum est me à vobis iudicari, aut ab humano die.</hi> If those which sit in scorners chaire shall contemne or condemne me, I will solace my selfe with <hi>Seneca, Argumentum est recti malis displicere.</hi> If my glorious Father and gracious mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iustifie me, I shall care litle who condemne me.</p>
            <p>Yet because Readers may be of diuers fashions and factions, some beneuolent and propitious, some maleuolent and captious; some ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, though malicious; some better instructed, yet humorous; some pregnant enough to discerne, yet as peeuish and peremptorie, either wittily to carpe, or wilfully to misconster, or wickedly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert and slander what may be mistaken or wrested; I haue thought good to addresse a few words, and become an humble suiter, or an earnest soliciter of all that shall reade, and will censure this my booke. For how many readers, so many censurers I looke to find. To whom I would tender in generall but two requests: That they would reade this booke with Christian humilitie, and censure it with brotherly charitie, without preiudice or partialitie. And perhaps it will not be amisse to reade twice, before they censure once.</p>
            <p>I was first moued and led to this labour by the commanding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treatie of my most reuerend Lord, whom I am bounden to honour
<pb facs="tcp:177094:5"/> and obey whilest I liue. A long sicknesse succeeded the first motion: yet it being rather tedious by continuance, then vexatious with pain, I made it aduantageable to my purpose, stole so much time for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and search, as furnished me with more speed to pen it, in that order wherein it is now digested.</p>
            <p>Wherein notwithstanding I had many impediments, well knowne vnto the places of my residence: as preaching euery Sabbath day, lecturing euery day in the weeke, exercising iustice in the Common-wealth, practising of Physicke and Chirurgerie, in the great penurie and necessitie thereof in the countrey where I liue, and that onely for Gods sake, which will easily multiply both clients and patients: yet the night hath affoorded me that which the day would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me: the silence and quiet whereof, hath ministred much mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and meanes to further my meditations. The due consideration whereof, I do not tender as a vaine boast, or an excuse for my selfe: but to stirre vp the able minds of many that are more learned, and better furnished in this kind then I am, who liue either in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall Churches or Colledges, or are placed ouer small congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where they haue more ease and leisure, with fewer distractions and impediments then such as my selfe haue, to set their hands and their hearts with <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to the repaire of Gods Temple and Citie, against <hi>Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Sanballat</hi> beyond the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that is, the Pope and the Iesuites, with other conspirators, who terrifie the peoples hearts from so needfull and gracious a worke as the entertainment of Christs truth and Gospel, to the sauing of their soules. The Pope with Briefe vpon Briefe, Priuiledge vpon Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge, Indulgence vpon Indulgence, encourageth his Iesuites and other Priests, Regulars and Seculars. They like swarmes of Locusts ouerspread the field where Gods precious seed is sowne, and are not onely diligent and painfull in compassing sea and land to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes, the children of hell, seuen times worse then themselues, but are ready to aduenture their liues, euen out of their bloud to raise a seed of sedition and rebellion to Antichrist their sole and soueraigne king; whilest too many amongst vs are so lumpish and idle, as if the danger appertained not vnto vs. We haue (blessed be the name of God) many vigilant Pastors and reuerent Doctors, that preach di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently, and write learnedly of all Controuersies questioned in these
<pb facs="tcp:177094:6"/> euill times, who neither preferre pleasure nor profit, nor honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aduancement of Gods glorie and the benefite of Christs Church; neither would spare their liues for the furtherance of the Gospell. Yet haue we some that are not prouoked by their good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, but propose vnto themselues a more broad, pleasant and easie way, as if the way were not narrow that leadeth to life. Whom I would onely intreate as brethren, seriously to consider the improbous labour and incessant industrie of our aduersaries, who are so captious as to cauill at all we say or do, that make mountaines of mole hils, great outcries vpon small occasions, God knoweth, and are readie to call our vertues vices, and for our sakes whom they hate, speake euill of the way of truth which we professe, and they know not; and neuer to suffer their hypocrisie to outface our sinceritie, their policy preuent our due circumspection, their crafty informations outstrip our plaine and honest dealing in the sight of God or men; lest their double dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in euill, rise vp in iudgement against our negligence in good: or lest their mouths be vniustly opened against the truth, for the vnholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of those that preach &amp; professe it. Let vs rather stop the mouths of foolish and ignorant men by wel doing, and glorifie God in our holy calling, lest God require it. O that the careful Gouernors, by the wel established discipline of our Church, would take order to stir vp the minds of such Ministers as are able vnto this work, and spur the idle forward, and make them go or bleed; and by due punishment chastise the insolency of fruitlesse and carelesse men if any such be, to a speedy reformation, or vtter expulsion; that the pleasant pasture of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring oxe, be not deuoured either by lazie asses or rauening wolues.</p>
            <p>My learned and studious fathers and brethren I would hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pray, friendly to admonish me of any thing in my booke, which an aduersarie may not onely iustly taxe, but probably calumniate; that I may receiue aduertisement and admonition from a friend, before a reproofe from an aduersarie; that the mouth of reproach may be stopped, before it be opened to slander the Gospell for my sake. If I shall haply receiue your approbation, it shall stand for my reall and comfortable contentment and satisfaction. Ʋpon the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, curious, captious or malicious I repose not my credit. For <hi>Ea est profectò iucunda laus quae ab his proficiscitur qui &amp; ipsi in laude vixerunt.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> If I haue offended, let the righteous smite me;
<pb facs="tcp:177094:6"/> for the stripe of a friend is better then the kisse of an enemie, when the balme of the wicked may breake my head. If the leud should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue or applaud me, I might fall into <hi>Antisthenes</hi> feare: <hi>O me miserum, metuo ne in crimen aliquod inciderim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any of our aduersaries shall vndertake by writing to answer this that I haue published, I would intreate them also that they would write as becometh Diuines, without the spirit of <hi>Rabsheca</hi> that railed on the liuing God. To auoid all personall calumniations, which as they are beside the cause, so do they not further the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any honest mind, and are most disgracefull to them that vse them. <hi>Michael</hi> gaue not railing words to the Diuell. It pleased God himselfe to visite and comfort his Prophet in a soft and still aire, rather then in fire, tempest or earthquake. It was a good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Discite à me, quia ego mitis &amp; humilis sum;</hi> and as good an example to follow, When he was reuiled, he reuiled not againe. Which I remember the rather, because many of our aduersaries bookes, wherein they answer others on whom they would raile, which mattereth not so much where no person is touched, are diuulged either without names at all, like speechlesse idols, or onely with a paire of letters, perhaps truly importing the first cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of their names, but for the most part transposed, that <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> himselfe could not find out the riddle: or a plaine counterfet name, as <hi>Mattheus Tortus</hi> for <hi>Robert Bellarmine,</hi> appearing vnto the world like whifflers at a play, with vizards of diuers shapes to terrifie or delude the simple, and to abuse whom they list without controlment, while themselues are vnknowne, as disguised in such hypocriticall and dissembled attire. Which notwithstanding is not onely censured as a fault in Printers, <hi>qui saepe tacito, saepe etiam emētito praelo, &amp; quod grauius est, sine nomine authoris im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primunt,</hi> by the Conuenticle of Trent, but also by a solemne Decree is forbidden for euer hereafter: <hi>Decernit &amp; statuit, vt nulli liceat imprimere, aut imprimi facere, quosuis libros de rebus sacris sine nomine autoris.</hi> Though they haue a crafty cautel following, yet this were a good rule, were it generally obserued, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of cōtrouersy, where there may be expectatiō of answer or reply.</p>
            <p>Finally, I would intreate, that if any answer be published, it be not generall, or at randon, or by snatches and peeces, but distinct
<pb facs="tcp:177094:7"/> and particular, either by Paragraph and Paragraph, or by Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Chapter, as it standeth in order. These conditions are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, friendly and Christian, becoming both the cause we handle, and the men we professe our selues to be; and so let <hi>causa cum cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa, ratio cum ratione concertare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Iesus giue a gracious blessing vnto these my paines in the worke of my Ministerie, and that not onely I, but all my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren may be found faithfull in the fruitfull emploiment of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents committed vnto vs, vnto the day of the straight reckoning and account, at that great iudgement, when euery mans worke shall be approued or disallowed before the feete of that Lord who shall iudge both quicke and dead at his appearing in glorie.</p>

                  <label>CHAP. XII.</label> For ancient Fathers, the Romanists offer vs new Fellowes with old names. Some graue men indeed, but stript out of their owne comely ornaments, and harrowed out of their wits, and so made incompetent iudges, or witnesses for the truth.

                  <label>CHAP.

               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. XVII.</label> Whatsoeuer is pretended of the corruption and apostasie of the Romane Church in faith or manners, it is most certaine that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes faith was once commended by the Apostle Saint Paul, and was after continued sound vnder the holy Martyrs, Bishops of that sea. Shew when, how, the time, the meanes by which this once holy Spouse of Christ fell from her first integritie, to such error in faith, such leudnesse of life?</item>
               <item>

               <item>
                  <label>CHAP. XX.</label> How may an vnlearned true hearted Christian Catholicke, in this present Romane defection from the true Church and faith, and
<pb facs="tcp:177094:9"/> in so great varietie of opinions as are now ventilated in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world, secure himselfe, and haue his conscience satisfied with comfort, that he is a member of the true, holy, ancient, Catholicke; and Apostolicke Church.</item>

No maruell then if many, neither so valorous as <hi>Iosuah,</hi> nor so wise in experiment of policy as the ancients of Israel, be sometimes ouertaken with this sleight, while the Gibeonites of Rome bring such old stuffe, moth-eaten and canker-fretted monumēts, that to the simple may beare a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable shew of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> but being throughly sifted and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously examined, they appeare, as indeed they are, meere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders vpon the ancient euidences of the Church, which they either falsifie by rasing, or interlining, or make away by imbezeling and purloyning, or sophisticate by glosing, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177094:11"/> commenting, or bring in their roome <hi>New</hi> inuentions vnder the names of old Authors, and so craftily cosin the people of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5 There is most danger and cunning in counterfeiting the most precious mettals. To sophisticate base minerals will neuer quite cost. This makes the Romanists so eager and desperate in adulterating of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> because it is a pearle of most esteemed price, which once entertained by them whom they desire to deceiue,<note place="margin">Hieron. ad Trapezitam.</note> is holdē as a <hi>Iewel</hi> of most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious value, but any skilful lapidary can soon espie the Alchu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

For that seemeth ancient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to some, that was done in their fathers dayes, a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or two before them. But this is not <hi>Antiquitie.</hi> We must ascend like a Psalme of degrees, not with the <hi>feet of our bodies, but with the affections of our hearts,</hi>

               <p n="2">2 A sorry &amp; silly tenant, that was neuer out of a hel of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery and misery, and therefore knoweth no better hauen of rest and felicity, will brag of his fathers Copies or leases, as if they were Euidences of such Antiquity, that could be found no where but in the Tower. So many pretend old Councels, and old Fathers, and old stories; but for the greatest, and grossest part of their religion, they haue but a few partiall assemblies, or late borne bastards, in their late fathers dayes. Is it not ridiculous to heare a prodigall princocke vanting of his gentility, because his father was an vpstart of a few yeares standing? when an other can auouch <hi>Codrus</hi> or <hi>Iaphet</hi> for his progenitor.</p>

We may answer <hi>Suarez,</hi> as <hi>Acasius</hi> answered <hi>Eleusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us; Quomodo Patres hos nominas, ô Eleusi, cum illorum non recipias Patres? How can you call these Fathers, (father Suarez) when you receiue not their fathers?</hi> though <hi>Acasius</hi> his cause were euil, yet his question was reasonable.</p>
               <p n="4">4 These are but yong boyes in comparison of old men, <hi>imberbes iuuenes,</hi> beardlesse youthes, conferred with that <hi>vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa canicies,</hi> those <hi>venerable gray haires,</hi> which are for their authoritie to be reuerenced. <hi>All the Iesuits will shortly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fathers of the Church, because in their pride they will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fathers aboue and beyond all their Orders, and then they will haue Fathers more then a good many.</hi> But one of <hi>Suarez</hi> brother Iesuits hath giuen better aduice from an ancient Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:<note place="margin">Mun. ciuit. sanctae fund. 1. ex.

Sed illis testibus qui ante hodiernum diem aut nudius tertius, non fuerunt inimici ne irati nocere cupiāt, ne laesi vlcisci se velint.</hi> Such witnesses who start not vp yesterday, nor the day before, and were not our enemies, lest being angry they seeke to hurt vs, or being offended, they seeke to reuenge themselues vpon vs. This is a good caution.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Therefore if the blacke guard be thus brought against vs, we appeale to the great Guard, from them to the Pentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, from them to the Nobles, from them to the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. Why should any man be barred of his best refuge? Will you produce the Schoolemen? we appeale to their Masters. Will you appeale to their Masters? we prouoke to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Wil you alledge their fathers? why may we not preferre their <hi>Grand-fathers,</hi> their great grand-fathers, and so to the Prophets, Apostles, and Christ our Sauiour himselfe? This is plaine and euident dealing, from the bottome to the top, from the kitchin to the hall; from the feete to the head of the Church. As for <hi>Suarez</hi> old Doctors, and <hi>saincted Fathers, the oldest of them reacheth not</hi> 500 yeares past. These are but the yong dayes of the corrupted Church: these sprang since Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, was loosed, and Antichrist began to reigne and rage in the Church. We dare not admit any thing for truth vpon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177094:25"/> their credit. They are domesticall and partiall witnesses, as farre short of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> as they are of their forefathers <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity:</hi> who as soone almost as they sprouted out, they were deuided into diuers factions: that <hi>Aristotle</hi> did not so much oppose <hi>Plato</hi> his old maister, or any one sect of Philosophers another, as the <hi>Thomists</hi> and <hi>Scotists</hi> did both dispute and write in their vehement contradictions; as if all diuinitie and religion were brought into a scholasticall quarrell, to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with wits, tongues, and pennes; yea almost, if not altogether, to plaine fists, buffets, and drie blowes: and all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their best maisters and oldest fathers.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Wherefore we must not hold <hi>Antiquity</hi> to be that which is <hi>Old,</hi> or is no older then these young Doctors; but that which is <hi>oldest,</hi> that is first and primitiue, without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or deriuations, or mingling, or medling with following ages, and after times. Water is best tried in the fountaine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath passed by the many varieties of diuers soiles.

               <p n="8">8 Traditions are questionable, both in their beginning &amp; acceptation.

And therefore neuer altered any thing the Law had commanded, but for all matters of doctrine or conuersation, they prouoked to the Law, as is cleare both by the story of the Kings and Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and by the Psalmes and other Prophecies, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly were learned and receiued from God, and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the Church for the direction thereof in his will and wayes.

The Priests and Leaders make head, they cry out against innouations, though it be for the better; they will confesse no faults, though their owne hearts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince and condemne them: all is heresie, or schisme, or error at the least, that sauoureth not their fancies, or answereth not their credits, or at least profits.

So is the Church <hi>the ground of truth also,</hi> the ground not onely to set it on, but also to sow it in, that it may bring forth fruite; not to ouerwhelme it, and stifle it, that it can bring forth no fruite. The field is the Church, the seed is the word: of this seed that is thus sowen, some falleth vpon good ground, some vpon bad; but all the seed is commended and committed to the ground, and so may be truly called, <hi>The ground of truth,</hi> that is, the ground for truth to be sowen in.

               <p n="38">38 First it is to be obserued, that whatsoeuer the Fathers write of the Catholique Church, the Papists wrest to the Church of Rome onely, and whatsoeuer they apply to the Church and BB. of Rome then in their dayes they presume to attribute to them now: then which nothing can be more absurd.

And Turcisme with the branches thereof at this day, is more vniuersall then the Romane Synagoue, or all that professe the Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.

And therefore take this name, or the signification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, there may be as Catholique an error as a truth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the name of Catholique is nothing without truth.</p>

Christ did many other miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, as curing sicke, cleansing leapers, halt, blind, lame, none came amisse vnto him; he raised the dead in the bed, in the coffin, in the graue: these cannot cure a halting dog, or a lame horse; they can do nothing, but that onely about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels, and therefore are certainly impostors, if they boast of this for a miracle.</p>
               <p n="79">79 I conclude with one of their owne, not Poets, but Preachers, who certainly saw that this was no mark to know the Church by, though he were in their Church as bright as a starre:<note place="margin">Stella in Lucā 9. v. 2. p. 252.</note>

That the world might giue credit to the Apostles, they wrought miracles, which now to do were superfluous, because now we beleeue those things which Christ preached: and if any such miracles should be now done, they would rather weaken the faith. Like as if a man had his cause sufficiently proued in iudgement, yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177094:59"/> he would proue it againe, and make his cause doubtfull, as if it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted proofe.

               <p n="80">80 <hi>Lumen Propheticum,</hi> the light of prophecie.<note place="margin">12. Lumen Propheticum.</note> Is this a proper note of your Church? Nothing lesse. For neither was the gift of prophesie either promised before Christs coming, or performed to the Church as a perpetuall gift, more then the gifts of healing, tongues, and such like: nor Prophets gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for perpetuall vse more then Euangelists and Apostles. There were in the primitiue Church, we grant, but we deny that to be your Church. But our question now is that which was not then. At that time as the prophesies continued, there was but one Christian Church dispersed into diuers nations, but fast bound vp in one vnitie of faith, that all men might see and know the Church of Christ by their consent in one truth according to the Scriptures, and so might be knowne without prophecying, and therefore this was not a necessary note then; for there were diuers Churches planted by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles that had no Prophets, and yet were true Churches; as also the Church of the Iewes was without Prophets from <hi>Malachi</hi> to Christ, about three hundred yeares, and yet was the onely true Church of God.</p>
               <p n="81">81 But the question present is, where is the true Church now? You say with you, you will proue it by the <hi>light of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</hi> Shew vs your Prophets, who are they? what foretell they? that we may heare and beleeue them. You haue none that you dare auouch, except the wench that cosened <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicus de Granada,</hi> and prophesied of the Spanish <hi>Armada</hi> in 1588. Then why should this be counted your badge, when it is not so much as pinned to your sleeue? Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> saith, we haue no Prophets: we confesse that none pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse themselues to be such; neither haue they any such; and therefore we are both deliuered from the labour of proofe for this point. Onely this I adde, that although God be onely
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:177094:60"/> able of himselfe to foretell contingents, and things to come, yet haue diuels, and Gentiles, and hereticks, at sundrie times prophesied by the permission of God. Neither did <hi>Balaam</hi> foretell onely what should be truly performed in Christ, or the time of Christianitie, but also concerning the Israelites and the Moabites; and yet he proued not himselfe the true Church wherin he liued. The <hi>Sybils</hi> among the heathen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied not onely of Christ, as <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, but of many other things which fell out among the heathen themselues, as by historie appeareth. And God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth by his Law, that if a Prophet shall foretell a thing to come, &amp; it come to passe, yet the Lord may send it to tempt or trie, whether men will stand to the truth of God. Such prophecies and Prophets there may be sufficient to deceiue, and that by Gods permission, and yet they neither in nor of the truth and true Church.

Mahomet</hi> and his Turkes acknowledge, that Christians may be saued, and that Christ was a great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. <hi>Totilas</hi> an <hi>Arian</hi> king had <hi>Saint Benedict</hi> in great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and admiration; therefore the moderne Church is the true Church. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> like mad <hi>Thrasilaus</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth all these commendations as belonging to himselfe. Our question is of the present Church of Rome? Proue
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:177094:60"/> Rome to be as these commended Christians were, and we will ioyne with it, as with an excellent member of Christs Catholike Church, as then it was.</p>
               <p n="83">83 All that professe Christ, and are called by the name of Christians, may claime these praises as well as the Romanes, and therefore this note belongeth not to them now, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the ancient Church deserued these and greater commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. But as the case standeth, the Papists are detested e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of Iewes and Turks for their most grosse and heathenish idolatrie. The Turkes hate those Christians most that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship images, and those are the Romanists. A Iew being asked why he would not embrace the Christian religion, it being so pregnantly proued by the conference of the old and new Testament; answered, that there were three impediments which did withhold him. The first was, that Christians wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped images, and maintained it, against the expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of almightie God; <hi>We should not fall downe before them nor worship them.</hi> The second, that <hi>Christians</hi> professedly did eate that God whom they did worship. The third, that <hi>Christians</hi> were mercilesse to the poore. If Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> wil haue a Iewes testimony, let him take this, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it where it best deserueth, he will haue little cause to boast of Turkes or Iewes. If other infidels were neare them, they would detest them, or at least enuie them, that they are greater idolaters then themselues. As an Indian asking, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Spaniards went when they died? It was answered to heauen; Then will I neuer come there, quoth he, where Spaniards are. So good are Romane Catholiques in infidels eyes.</p>

               <p n="93">93 Then belike they were not the true Church when they were in such pressure: but they were when they had <hi>temporall felicitie.</hi> But Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> knoweth well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that this is farre from being any certaine note, or so much as probable, seeing it may so easily <hi>adesse &amp; abesse sine subiecti interitu.</hi> The Church may haue it or want it, without preiudice or benefit. If the Church haue it, she must be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; if she haue it not, she must be patient: neither hindreth the wicked, neither hurteth Gods children. Let prosperitie come to the wicked like the comfortable Sunne, yet it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hardneth them like clay in their malice, or melteth them like the fat of lambes to their consumption. Let aduersitie befall the righteous, it will either soften them to repentance if they liue, or passe them vnto glory if they die.

So that of this, and of this onely we may truly say, <hi>Where verity of doctrine gathered out of the Scriptures, which is the most ancient truth, and so is faithfully preached and rightly beleeued, there and no where else is the true Church.</hi> And againe, that you may see how the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition agreeth with the thing described, and maketh it a certaine note, that admitteth no exception or contradiction, note this, <hi>That is the true Church where the veritie of doctrine gathered out of the Scriptures of God, which is most ancient, is faithfully preached and rightly beleeued.</hi> Against this neither the altars of Rome, nor the gates of hell, shall neuer be able to preuaile, <hi>Rumpantur &amp; ilia Codro,</hi> though the Pope and his Cardinals burst their hearts to withstand it.</p>

Let them adde the truth of doctrine to Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and we wil professe our selues to be of the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church: otherwise the bare name, which is but the shell, we leaue vnto them; truth of doctrine, which is the kernell, we reserue to our selues. So is Antiquitie<note place="margin">Antiquitie.</note> without veritie, nothing but a blast of vanitie. Truth of a dayes birth, must be preferred before it.

                  <hi>Let vs suppose,</hi> quoth he, <hi>that they beleeue that the old and new Testament are holy Scripture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Romane Church saith so.</hi> Neuer suppose it, for my part I neuer thought it. No? saith the Doctor, <hi>Catholiques</hi> (by which he meanes <hi>Catholique Romanes,</hi> (as after in the same se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) <hi>haue had the Scriptures in their keeping time out of minde, as all histories, all Councels, all ancient Tradition will witnes for vs. And so at least by praescription, Catholiques are the true and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full possessors of the Scriptures, yea histories and the ancient bookes of the Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> Where you see they haue <hi>All Histories,</hi> yea and <hi>Histories</hi> too.

               <p n="6">6 What if we should tel the Doctor, that we had the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from the same hand that they had receiued them? The old testament from the Iewes in the naturall tongue wherein it was written, the new Testament from the Greeke Church in the tongue then most common in the world, wherein it was also indited? If the Iewes kept the Scriptures for their betters (so the Romanists repute themselues,) why might not the Papists keepe them for vs, and yet we their betters? Or is not the gate as open for vs, to leade vs vnto the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as for the Romanes? Or will they haue the Iewes of their Catholique Romane Church? Or will they haue the Greeke and Romane Church all one, who haue liued and do liue in diuision vnto this day? The <hi>Grecians</hi> washed their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:177094:68"/> after a Romane Priest had said his Masse. The Romanes take the Greeke Church to haue bene a very long time schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall, and for some hundred yeares hereticall: yet had they the Scriptures in their naturall language, more true and vncorrupt then the Romanes (by their more then a good many translations) had. And therefore we may iustly say, that as it hath pleased God the <hi>Philistins</hi> should keepe the Arke of God for a time, without violation,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 5. &amp; 6.</note> though it was their scourge and plague: so it pleased him in his prouidence to make the Iewes and Grecians his keepers of the treasure of holy Scriptures, without corruption, to their shame and confusion, from whom both you and we haue receiued them. If otherwise we haue receiued them from you, it was at the last and worst hand, corrupted by your translations, and therefore we are not beholding to you, so much as we both vnto them: and it fareth with you from vs, as with them from vs or you, for you are well curried and cudgelled with them by all our writers, as well as they by either of vs.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Were it not a fine dispute of the Iewes and Grecians, to tell the Romanes that they are theeues, <hi>and no lawfull pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors, and therefore haue no right to vse (the Scriptures) especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally against the true owners?</hi> Christians may not vse the Law and the Prophets against the Iewes, to proue that Iesus Christ is the true <hi>Messias:</hi> nor the West Church against the East, to proue that the holy <hi>Ghost</hi> proceedeth from the Father and the Sonne. For they had no right to vse them <hi>against the true ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Or will they pretend that those were neuer the true ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? They may as well deny that God was the author of them. For they all were written in their tongues, and most for their sakes principally, and accordingly sent vnto them.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Did any of the ancient Fathers reason thus with the most damnable heretiques that euer were? that they neuer knew Scriptures to be Scriptures, but by the Church? that they vsurped them frō the true owners? that they might not vse them without their leaue?

It is prouerbially said, that when two ride on a horse, one must ride behind; so when two fellowes crosse and contradict one another, one must prooue a foole or a knaue, except they will counterpoise themselues, and be both alike. Was it not <hi>Dauids</hi> great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that he cut off <hi>Goliahs</hi> head with his owne sword?<note place="margin">1. Sam. 17.51. 1. Sam. 21.9.</note> and was not that sword laid vp for a monument of that victorie? What differs our case? Antichrist of <hi>Rome</hi> claimeth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177094:70"/> for his owne sword, will haue it close to his owne side, and tied at his girdle; what if a valiant <hi>Dauid,</hi> a no bodie in the giants eyes, should take this sword of the Scriptures from him, and cut off his head? were it not a token of more valour? were it not worth the laying vp to <hi>Dauids</hi> vse for euer? To this sence was that prouerbe vsed, <hi>Suo sibi iugulo gladio,</hi> I ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him with his owne weapon, I confuted him with his owne argument, I got my possession by his owne euidence. All this by way of supposition. For we will neuer grant, that the Scriptures are more theirs, or so much theirs as ours, or that we had them otherwise from them, but as from <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes custodes,</hi> common treasurers after Iewes and Grecians.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Yet let vs make the same supposition againe, that the Scriptures are theirs, and theirs onely. Why then do they so debase and vilifie them? why do they refuse al triall by them? why do they call them, bare Scriptures, contemptuously, dead letters blasphemously? or if they forsake them and cast them from them, why may not we take them vp, and make our iust benefit of them? They are like a dog in a manger, neither can eate themselues, nor suffer those that could. They wil challenge the keeping of the <hi>key of the kingdome of heauen, but they wil neither enter in themselues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 23.13.</note>
                  <hi>nor suffer those that would.</hi> This is certainly a dogged and spitefull nature. They wil nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acknowledge the soueraigntie of the Scriptures, nor suffer others to take benefit by them: they denie their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and will boast of their possession. In this there is neither rithme nor reason, no glory but shame. For all this claime of Doctor <hi>Kellison,</hi> the Chapter following shall sufficiently proue, how they vse this pupill, whom they thus pretend to be committed to their charge. How basely they reiect it, and make this Scepter of Christs kingdome, this glorious Kings sonne, this birth of the morning, this rule of righteousnesse, a very scullian in their basest seruices, a very darknesse of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> a crooked rule, by which nothing can be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected. Howsoeuer they pretēd their tutorage ouer it: which notwithstanding it recouereth its strength, and remaineth it selfe to be at the least the first and chiefest part of <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:177094:70"/> if they will not allow it to be the onely. In this case we say of their so much bragd of possession,<note place="margin">Praefat. in Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</note> as Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writes of the Iewes. <hi>Illi habent libros, nos librorum Dominum: illi tenent Prophetas, nos intelligentiam Prophetarum; illos occidit litera, nos viuificat Spiritus; apud illos Barrabas latro dimittitur, nobis Christus Dei filius soluitur.</hi> You Romanists, as the Iewes, haue the bookes, but we haue the Lord of these bookes; you hold the Prophets, we the meaning of the Prophets: the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kils you, the Spirit quickeneth vs; you let loose <hi>Barrabas</hi> the theefe, that is, your traditions, we set at libertie Christ the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Doctor <hi>Kellisons</hi> other cauill is, that though we <hi>so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly alledge Scriptures, yet we decide all by the bare letter of the Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">D.

That we deceiue the <hi>people with bare Scriptures,</hi> without the sap and sence, the pith and marrow of them; as if we went but to the huskes, or fed on bare bones, and that therefore the people should take heede of vs, and not <hi>beleeue their Ministers when they proue what they preach by Scriptures.</hi> (No? not when they proue by Scriptures? (the words proofe goes farre;) because forsooth heretickes do so. Because <hi>Tertullian refuseth flatly to dispute with Heretickes by bare Scriptures, and therefore no maruell if we refuse to decide controuersies with them by bare Scriptures. For bare Scriptures is of a waxie nature.</hi> Thus farre and much more, but all to the same purpose, hath Doctor <hi>Kellison</hi> made a bare tale. Will any man beleeue him in a case so apparently false? so opposite to his owne and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes consciences of vs, if they should be well examined, of that they dayly heare, and reade of vs and ours? Or need I now answer him that which hath bene answered by B. <hi>Iewell</hi> B. <hi>Bilson,</hi> by D. <hi>Rainolds,</hi> D. <hi>Whitakers</hi> in this very case? What importunitie is this? What art of railing &amp; false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations is here? As if our Sauiour Christ may not proue by
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:177094:71"/> the Scriptures because the diuell alledged them,<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> or Christ must not be beleeued though he proue by Scriptures, because the diuell presumed so to do.<note place="margin">Aug. de set. Domini in mont. l. 2.</note>
                  <hi>Non debet ouis pellem suam depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere, quòd lupi aliquando se ea contegant,</hi> The sheepe must not part with his skin, because wolues sometimes couer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therewith. The Scribes and Pharises, and Sadduces had more modestie then these men. When our Sauiour had once solidly cōfuted them by the Scriptures, they were afterward silent, <hi>and no man durst aske him any more questions.</hi> The diuell himselfe departed, after three wounds receiued; our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries stand desperatlie to it, though they receiue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand.</p>
               <p n="14">14 <hi>Campion</hi> complaines that they hauing the letter we will haue the figure: D. <hi>Kellison,</hi> that they haue the sence and meaning, we, as he pleaseth to style it, the <hi>bare Scripture.</hi> Which of these is the truer? <hi>A nobis verbasunt</hi> (saith <hi>Campion</hi>) the words are for vs. What are these words, but the bare letter? We desire the meaning by conference with other Scriptures, by the antecedents and consequents of the text; as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> would haue vs: neither will we deny the harmonie of the Fathers concurring with such expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Haue you not giuen vs a sword to cut your owne throats? Or if you will claime both swords, as your Pope doth, you are verie cowards; Will you assaile with both, and haue vs defend with neither, when both are in our hands, as well and safer then in yours? If we vrge the words, you crie for the meaning: if we vrge the meaning, you crie for the words. What strange presumption is this, that you will haue it as you list? we must haue it as you will allow it? You will haue, <hi>hoc est corpus meum,</hi> taken according to the letter, we o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.5.</note> in figure. We would haue those words <hi>There is but one God, and one mediator betwixt God and man,</hi> to be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter: you, not without a strange distinction, abhorrent from the Scripturer. We must descend vnto you; you will not yeeld an inch vnto vs; are you not partiall in your owne conceipts?<note place="margin">Iames. 2.4. Saint Francis.</note> We know and will ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that there are many places of the Scriptures plaine, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:177094:71"/> to be taken according to the letter, and all other sences will be absurd. There are other places, that if they be taken ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the letter, they will kill, as our Sauiour speaketh,<note place="margin">Iohn 6. De doct.

                  <q>He seemeth to command a wicked thing or an hainous crime, to forbid that which is profitable and beneficiall, this is a figuratiue speech. If ill be commanded or good forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, there is a figure. And he exemplifieth it by those words of our Sauiour.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 But if you will presse vs with the sence onely, why take you the letter? If you be reproued for the letter, why do you vsurpe it your selues? Let vs be bound to the same law, and we will aske no more libertie then your selues do take. Though in this your contradiction you do both together lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lesse, then grant vs both, while one saith we haue the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the other, that we haue the sence. Howbeit what need we thus dispute? a flat negatiue were sufficient in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. If a man may speake it in ciuilitie, you flatly and falsely bely vs; we stand not on the bare letter of Scripture, more then you. We professe with Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> that the Gospell doth consist, <hi>Non in verbis Scripturarum, sed in sensu,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Com. in Gal. 1.</note> not in the words of the Scriptures, but in the sence; not in the barke but in the sap, <hi>not in the leaues of the words, but in the roote of the meaning. Non in legendo, sed in intelligendo,</hi>

               <p n="16">16 This haue all our writers professed; this do we stand to in the sight of God and man; this we defend in the face of our enemies. What need D. <hi>Kellison</hi> or father <hi>Campion</hi> bleare the eyes of their silly proselytes (whom they make seuen fold the children of hell worse then themselues) with this slanderous imputatiō, as if we had nothing but <hi>bare Scripture</hi> without any true sence or meaning thereof? If this protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yeeld not satissaction to their imperswasible iealousie &amp; implacable malice, we wil giue it in D. <hi>Kellisons</hi> own words,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177094:72"/> and wish from our hearts, he would stand to his own doome, and that might be the issue and end of all strife. He saith thus. <hi>If they giue vs the letter of Scripture with the true meaning,</hi>

                  <hi>which is the formall cause and life of the word, we will reuerence it as the word of God, and preferre it before all the decrees of the Pope and Church.</hi> I would it were in our power to giue you this; or the grace of God were in you, to receiue it. As you can in no reason yeeld vs lesse, so we in our conscience would aske you no more, but that the letter of Scripture <hi>with the true meaning might be preferred before all Popes and Church.</hi> This had bene a sufficient <hi>supersedeas</hi> to your Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and would soone stop your mouthes euery day.

But when <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, Epiphanius, Augustine</hi> wrote bookes, or rather volumes against the Iewes and heretickes, did they confute them by the authoritie of the Church? or Councels, or Fathers, or Traditions not written? or by any things else but onely by the Scriptures?</p>

For neither are the words the same with those in the Apostles Councell, neither do the words depend vpon their owne sence, but on antecedent proofes; neither seemeth it to haue bin a Councel of Bishops solemnly assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, but rather counsell communicated one to another. The Apostles words are, <hi>It seemeth good to the holy Ghost and to vs.</hi> But in Saint <hi>Cyprian, It hath pleased vs by the suggestion of the holy Ghost.</hi> The Apostles had not onely the holy Ghost brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vnto them by our Sauiour, but receiued him in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe of clouen tongues. And therefore they knew the mind of the holy Ghost by immediate suggestion, and might well say, It seemeth good to the holy Ghost and to vs. But these African Fathers, after they had alledged many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and vrged many reasons out of them, by this imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate suggestion of the holy Ghost within those Scriptures, and by those reasons before giuen, do conclude: For these are the certaine suggestions of the holy Ghost. Which may be further probably conceiued by the very position of the words. The Apostles put the holy Ghost first, themselues af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to signifie they had the immediate suggestion; the other put themselues in order before this suggestiō, the holy Ghost after, to note they had the mind of the holy Ghost in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed word, &amp; neither by visiōs or sights: wherby they were more perswaded of the mind of the holy Ghost. So the words haue not dependance of the Fathers themselues, but on those allegations and reasons before suggested and produced. And finally, this seemeth not to be an assembled Councell, but a conference, either by letters, or communicating one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and sending for subscription or consent; which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the beginning of the Epistle, where they mention
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:177094:82"/> not a Synod or Councell, but rather <hi>participato inuicem consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> hauing conference or taking counsell one with another: which may as wel be in absence as in presence, as well at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times as at once, as well by some, and some often, as by an assembly altogether. For there is as much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Concilium,</hi> that is, a Synod or assembly, and <hi>consilium</hi> which is an aduice, as there is betweene <hi>decipere</hi> and <hi>desipere,</hi> that is, to play the knaue, or the foole; or with nearer resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance if it may be, a Maister <hi>incipiens</hi> and <hi>insipiens,</hi> the first may begin well, the other may begin, continue, and end an Asse.</p>
               <p n="8">8 I maruell the <hi>Rhemists</hi> were so ill aduised to alledge this to proue it a rule, that all Councels may vse the Apostles phrase, seeing they haue none but this, that I can find by mine owne search, or enquiry of others as yet, and this farre vnlike that: neither is this a Councell in their owne account; and if one, yet a priuate one, that can giue no rule nor good example to generall Councels, by their owne learning; yea and that one so priuate, yet presuming to set their names be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Cornelius</hi> the great Patriarch and Pope of Rome, being themselues but meane Bishops, and to call him Brother, that <hi>instylo nouo,</hi> in the new style is the Papists <hi>Pater Patrum,</hi> the Father of Fathers: and so to preuent those heretical doctrines that afterwards inuaded that Sea, when they concluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pope heard of it, (what a sacriledge is this in the Romane Synagogue?) and to teach that all must receiue the cup of the Lord: which ancient custome is now abolished by good <hi>Cornelius</hi> his wicked successors.

For if subtill <hi>Rebecca</hi> must be the Church, then blind <hi>Isaac</hi> must stand for God; for he was her husband, as Christ was the Churches. Yet his speech may stand good, though his proofe be naught. For if he take the Catholique faith for the present Romane faith, it is very true, that no pregnant place of Scripture cleareth it; but if he take it for the truth of God, euerie Chapter, euerie sentence proueth it. But this mattereth little, for elsewhere thus he saith, abusing a place of <hi>Turtullian</hi> which he wrote to a

The farther conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof must be deferred, till I shall speake of the crackt and rotten props of the Romane Synagogue.

               <p n="2">2 So gracious is the name of Councels, so venerable is the assemblies of Fathers.

               <p n="3">3 We hold the ancient Councels in eminent authoritie, but they are not like the wisedome of God, who built his word as he formed the world in the creation, when he did all things, <hi>Numero, pondere &amp; mensura,</hi> in number,<note place="margin">Wisd. 11.17.</note> weight and measure, and established it for euer, and saw that all he had made was good. There were no superfluities, no dispropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no defects, no blemish in the Scriptures, as is prooued. In the Councels it hath not bene so, by our aduersaries owne confession, as will afterwards appeare.<note place="margin">1.

But at the second,<note place="margin">Nehe. 4.17.</note> the opposition of importable and implacable enemies, made them worke on the wals of the citie, with working instruments in one hand, and their weapons in the other. So when it pleased God to haue his Scriptures written, there descended the immediate influence of Gods Spirit into the hearts of the pen-men, who though dispersed into diuers parts of the world, yet all agreed whē their writings were conferred. It was not so with Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, they had need of the countenance &amp; protection of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, and weapons of warre, and the guard of souldiers. Though many were gathered into one place, yet they came not all with one mind, they handled not matters after one manner, there were high words, long disputations, vehement contradictions, change of sentence, from worst to better sometimes, and not seldome, from better to worse. Therefore call them the Church, or what you will, you may perhaps ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them in <hi>armatura fortium,</hi> but they are not that perfect

               <p n="4">4 I could find in my heart to affoord that vnto the Councels in comparison of the Scriptures, that I would vnto the blessed <hi>Virgine Mary</hi> in respect of her Sonne. And our aduersaries slander vs in both alike. Because that we mislike, that the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due vnto the onely begotten Sonne of God, the onely Sauiour of the faithfull, should be attributed to a creature, though she be the mother of God, we are accused to speake euill and disdainfully of her, and preferre euery woman that hath more children, before her. When God knoweth, as the truth is, there is no title of honour giuen vnto her, by the holy Scriptures, or any solide or primarie antiquitie, but we will yeeld it with all respect and reuerence: onely we dare not place her in her Sonnes throne, and giue her the worship due vnto him. She hath doubtlesse, as <hi>Bathsheba,</hi> a seate on the Kings right hand,<note place="margin">1. King. 2.69.</note> and must haue her due respect, as the Kings mother; but we giue her not so much, much lesse triple honor in respect, in the presence of her Sonne; That she sit, and he stand, she with a crowne and he none; she with three crownes vpon one head,<note place="margin">In diuers pictures.</note> in the forme of a Popes triple crowne; he with one single or perhaps a crowne of thornes. We like a meane, we mislike excesse; we would giue all due, but presume not to rob God of his owne glorie. This very account we make of Councels. We like and allow them: we giue them a reuerend seate by the throne of the holy Scriptures, euen at the right hand, but as a subiect, not as a soueraigne; as a wife, if you will, but not as a husband; to moderate the affaires of the houshold committed to her charge, but not to checke and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerrule the Lords gouernment.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Examine all our writers and their writings, and see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not speake of Councels in this manner, and as the ancient Fathers did in their times.

In matters indifferent we giue them power to determine, for comlinesse and order, and the preseruation of peace in the whole bodie. For interpretations of Scripture,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:177094:97"/> we will not derogate from them, but wil either accept of thē, or answer them with due respect. For matters of fact we will beleeue them, for their times, as diligent searchers after the truth.

By all which it appeareth, that neither the Fathers, who liued so neare them, both in time and place, gaue them such vncontrollable authoritie, as if all were Gospell they spake, or that the Councels had euer that good respect as was wished and expected; and therefore they must needs come short of that soueraigne and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminent authoritie, which we may giue by good right vnto the Scriptures of God.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But if we shall speake of the later ages of the Church, we can by no meanes yeeld that their Councels were either lawfully summoned, or indifferently managed, or happily concluded; whereof afterward there will be occasion to speake more at large: vntill then, all courteous and iudicious Readers may plainly see, and, I hope, will as ingenuously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that notwithstanding we are traduced by our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to set light by Councels, to despise and reiect them, yet we haue a due estimation of them, as much as may stand with the safetie of truth, and the honour of Gods word, written in the Scriptures. Which is more then our aduersaries will performe, whatsoeuer they promise and pretend to their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-credulous disciples. For when they speake of Councels in generall, they would make the world beleeue, that we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake and renounce them all, that they receiue and admit eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. There was a well conceited friend, that would euer boast his neighbours with his owne liberalitie, in distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his apples, in comparison of another that was very kind indeed; and would say, he is miserable, he giues his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples but by dishfuls or stroakes, but I am bountifull, that giue mine by quarters. Whether would you take for the franker man? He that gaue by quarters, you would thinke. But it was not so: he talked of quarters, as if they had bene sacks full; but they were but quarters of one apple cut into foure parts. Euen so it fareth with the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> They will be tried by the Councels, and they will tell you of so many in <hi>Peter Crabs</hi> Edition, so many and so good of <hi>Surius</hi> his setting forth, yea more and better done by <hi>Dominicus Nicolinus</hi> in fiue volumes, by <hi>Binius</hi> best of all, so fairely
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:177094:99"/> printed, so diligently perused, so carefully corrected, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to old Copies, in fiue greater <hi>Ʋolumes.</hi> You would think the Church of Rome offred vs quarters, that is, whole sackfulls of Councels, but come to receiue them, they proue but quarters in a lesse volume. They admit but eighteene without exception, a very few to so many pretended; and the best of those not only drawne violently to their purpose, but suspended or hanged (in plaine English) at their pleasure, yea embowelled and quartered too, except they can make them to serue their purposes. The former was a merrie, but this is a dangerous equiuocation.</p>
               <p n="11">11 And not to defraud your expectations longer in this behalfe: first vnderstand our aduersaries dealing with the body of the Councels. They exclude all prouinciall and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Councels, not out of their books, but put them out of credit, when they make against them, or not for them; so do not we.<note place="margin">Greg. de Val.</note> And though they seeme to allow as many as are confirmed by Popes, they receiue not all the generall; no more do we. They refuse many better Councels and accept worse; so will not we. They except against some particulars in the best; we not so much, nor so often as they, but euer vpon better cause then they yet euer haue done, or I feare will do. They will admit or reiect what they list, in the same Councell; we desire to be equally obliged, to all, or to none. For that Councell that erreth in one, may erre in more, and so in all; and that that bindeth in one, bindeth in all, or not at all. I remembred before,<note place="margin">Supra cap. 5.</note> that when <hi>Bellarmine</hi> distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth of generall Councels, some are approued, some repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or reprobated, some partly confirmed, partly reiected; one neither manifestly allowed, nor manifestly disallowed. To omit the others for a while: consider how a generall Councell is by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defined.<note place="margin">Concil. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesinum ad tuendam vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum.</note>
                  <hi>Generalia dicuntur ea qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus interesse possunt &amp; debent Episcopi totius orbis, nisi legitimè impediantur, &amp; in quibus nemo rectè praesidet nisi Romanus Ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fex aut alius eius nomine.</hi>
                  <q>Those are called generall Councels, at which all the Bishops of the whole world may be, and should be, except they be lawfully hindred; and in which
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:177094:100"/> no man may rightly be President but the Bishop of Rome, or some other in his name.</q> The first part of this definition is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, the other is vnreasonable. Whereupon I may iustly inferre, that since the Apostles time there was neuer gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell in the Church; &amp; that there neuer can be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councel with any indifferency. For the first, neuer could, neuer ought, much lesse euer did, all the Bishops of the whole world gather together into one Councell. When were euer the <hi>Abisens,</hi> or the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> or the <hi>Indians,</hi> either summo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that they might come; or stayed for, till they could come; or were censured for not coming; or talked of, as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers missed in that body? I trow neuer. Therefore there was neuer generall Councell whereunto the whole Church must stand obliged. And it is impossible that euer there should be.</p>
               <p n="12">12 For <hi>Bishops</hi> are to be presupposed ancient men before they are chosen, and so are for the most part; (except the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane boy Bishops, and boy Cardinals, and boy Popes too, if you will.) It will aske diuers years to send &amp; receiue answers from some, wherin may be so many changes vnknowne and vnheard of, by the deaths of men, that no certaintie can be of their assembling.</p>
               <p n="13">13 For the Popes precedencie it neither was in the first generall Councels, nor required, neither ought it to be euer or at all, as hereafter shall appeare. Besides, we deny that in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the first &amp; chiefe Councels the Pope was President, &amp; therfore by the Cardinals definition they were no Councels. But we will suppose them to be generall, which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> &amp; others that write of Councels call so. Of some of those gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, some are approued, some not. If they be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall they may not be reiected, for they haue the confluence of Bishops &amp; the Pope President,<note place="margin">Bell. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. aut. l. 2. c. 1.</note> else are they not generall. <q>
                     <hi>Dico Concilium illud non posse errare quod absolutè est generale &amp; Ecclesiam vniuersam perfectè repraesentat:</hi> I say that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell cannot erre which is absolutely generall, and perfectly representeth the whole Church.</q> Being so generall, and the body &amp; head cleauing together, why should they be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated?
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:177094:100"/> Why should they not be approoued? Either they were not generall; or being generall, by your owne learning they could not erre, and then no reason to reprooue them. Or final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being generall, they did erre, and therefore were iustly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected. The same may be said of the part which is said of the whole. If they were generall, why are they not approoued, as well in all as in part? If they be not generall, why do you giue them that title? And why refuse you them in part, and not in all? I know not what to say to the post-alone, that is neither manifestly reiected, nor manifestly accepted. It may not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted because <hi>Antonius</hi> saith, it was <hi>Conciliabulum illegitimum,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anton.</note> an vnlawfull Conuenticle, and because it rather increased then diminished the schisme. If it be without doubt reprooued, then without doubt <hi>Alexander</hi> the sixt should not haue called himselfe the sixt, but the fift. A perillous matter. What is the summe of all this? Verily those Councels that make for them in all, those are all theirs; those which haue any thing for thē, those are in so much theirs; those which haue ought against them, are in so much none of theirs. They haue a great facilitie in sauing themselues harmelesse.</p>

               <p n="24">24 Now for the interpretation of the sixt Canon of this Councell, there is almost as great variety. We alledge this Canon to proue, that the Bishop of Rome for his iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is confined, as an Archbishop or a Patriarke, at most to his Prouince and countries adioyning, as <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch</hi> are to theirs. And that he hath no more iurisdiction ouer them, then they ouer him. Which we say is plaine in the text in all editions, and all translations. This our aduersaries are so farre from granting, as that they would not onely haue it not abet this truth, but would wrest it, and wreath it, quite contrary.<note place="margin">Can. 6.</note> The words as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath them are: <q>
                     <hi>Mos anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quus perduret in Egypto, vel Libya &amp; Pentapoli, vt Alexandrinus Episcopus horum omnium habeat potestatem, quoniam quidem &amp; Episcopo Romano parilis mos est.</hi> Let the ancient custome conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new in Egypt, or Libya and Pentapolis, that the Bishop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria hath power ouer all these, because the Bishop of Rome hath the like custome.</q> The sence whereof we take to be, that Alexandria should exercise iurisdiction ouer those Churches neare vnto it, as Rome did those near vnto her: <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> keepeth a foule coile about this Canon. First he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth how Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> would haue it, or there wants some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in the Canon before: <hi>Ecclesia Romana semper habuit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> "the Church of Rome euer had primacie.

                  <hi>That the Bishop of Alexandria should haue the charge of Egypt, as the Bishop of Rome had the charge of the Churches adioyning.</hi> Thus we take it, and therefore haue <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie</hi> for vs. The second is of <hi>Theodorus Balsamon</hi> and of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:177094:105"/> That the Bishop of Alexandria should haue the same charge of all Egypt, as the Bishop of Rome had of the West. Bellarmine</hi> likes them better for their liberalitie, that they giue more then <hi>Ruffinus</hi> giues; yet he will not haue his Maister tyed vp in so short a tether, <hi>Aut Caesar, aut nullus,</hi> either all or none. We could thinke well of this as the times then were, when the Church was confined into a narrower roome then since it hath bene, when the charge is too big for him, were he as big againe. It is too heauie for <hi>Atlas</hi> that was fained to carrie heauen on his shoulders. The third is of <hi>Caranza</hi> the epitomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer of the Councels, who telleth (though <hi>Bellarmine</hi> omitteth it) <hi>That he was shewed an old edition by a Cardinall, where in stead of Romano Episcopo, was Metropolitano Episcopo,</hi> in stead of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane was Metropolitane. This also maketh for vs with great aduantage, written by a Papist, shewed by a Cardinall, both our aduersaries, and therefore good witnesses for vs, out of an old copie, which sauours of <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> but all these are all one, or none at all with <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> He hath a crotchet in his owne head, and will reach a note aboue <hi>Ela,</hi> but he will fetch it; and therefore he bringeth a fourth exposition, and I beleeue you will thinke a very strange one. <hi>Because the Romane Bishop was so accustomed,</hi> which is not in the text by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe alledged: that is, because the Bishop of Rome before any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions of Councels, did vse to <hi>permit vnto the Bishop of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria the gouernment of Libya and Pentapolis: Siue consueuit per Alexandrinum Episcopum illas prouincias gubernare;</hi>
                  <q>Or that the Bishop of Rome accustomed to gouerne those prouinces by the Bishop of Alexandria. The last and the worst.

Which answer is halfe foolish, halfe mad.</q> It erres in that wherein it erreth, and is vnlawfull wherein it is vnlawfull; or it is vnlawfull in that wherein it erreth.

The mad part is, <hi>in fact it hath erred, when it is reproued by the Apostolicall sea.</hi> It hath erred in the preterperfect tense, if the Pope reproues it in the present tense. As much to say, though it was once lawfull, yet if the Pope afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it, then it is vnlawfull. Alas poore Councell! I see the

But in this, his and his fellowes madnesse is made manifest vnto all men; that what maketh for them, they can be contented to entertaine it; that which is not for their profit, lightly to regard it: that which makes against them, vtterly to discard, and cast it to the middin or dunghil. Would they vse the foure Gospels as the foure first, and (I say still) best Councels are vsed? If for shame they might, they would, euen as plainly: which they do in some sort, though with some more shew of wit in couering more closely their

So deale the Romanists with the faithfull professors of Christs truth at this day. To shade their owne shame, they would impose that on vs which we neuer imagined in thought, but themselues haue openly practised in deed, in the view of the whole world.

Then outcries were made, that when they could not answer the authoritie, they would discountenance the author.

Wherein they haue vsed most egregious impostures, and such as they which know them not, will hardly beleeue them.

My hearts desire onely is, that all partialitie and fore-prising laid aside, the very truth of God may appeare on this behalf, and that each partie, according to the euidence thereof, may be iustified or reformed.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The worst that we say of the Fathers in generall, or in particular, or that we would any other should say, is, that most of the Fathers had their errors, their blemishes, their spots.

               <p n="60">60 If this they cannot proue, (as God and his Sonne <hi>Christ</hi> ruling by his word, they neuer shall) then we may most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly conclude, that though in shew they pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the onely treasurers of the Scriptures, the onely kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of the Councels, the onely preseruers of the Fathers; yet when they are brought to the issue, they neither care for the Scriptures, nor rest on Councels, nor respect Fathers, but as the old Romanes their slaues to serue their turnes, or the Turke his vassals to fill ditches. What they can ingeniously, fairely, faithfully, and conscionably answer vnto this, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test I know not. If they say, they alledge most of the Fathers in sundry controuersies, we deny it not. But we aske, with what sinceritie do they alledge them? and what confidence they repose in them, when they make against them? This is manifest by that which hath bene said: whatsoeuer Friar <hi>Ʋalentia</hi> saith to the contrarie,<note place="margin">Greg. de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentia. l. 6. c. 12.</note> in his vaine boast and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. <q>

If I had him by the nose, as S. <hi>Dunstan</hi> had the diuell with a paire of tongues, I would not let him go, till he had recalled this lye. For he knoweth it as well to be vntrue, as the diuell knoweth that he is a lyer, and the father thereof.</p>
               <p n="61">61 If they say, that we, or some of ours haue refused some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, or giuen some harsh tearmes to some of the Fathers, we grant it.

If they vse any vnreuerend speech of any approued Father, we defend them not; we wish they had not; and we are right sure not worse then our aduersaries themselues haue done, not so ill by much, as I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>

The other succeeding Bishops, for about 300 yeares after, by litle and litle declined, till the number of the name, and mystery of the Beast began to be written in capitall letters in the forehead of the Romish harlot; and the seruants of Antichrist so inuaded the Church, that all that do but runne by the histories of the Church may reade it, and but lap as the dogs by Nilus, may taste and feele, that when Deuotion had brought forth riches, the mother was deuoured of the daughter, and then wealth wanted not issue; for it begat pride, pride begat ambition, ambition schisme, schisme he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, heresie corruption both of faith and manners.</p>

               <p n="10">10 Concerning all which, this shall be our rule: We will

Neither will we adde any other vnto them, but such as were euer reputed Romane Catholiques for their religion, and for their faction plaine Papists.</p>
               <p n="11">11 As for later Legends, which are now as graue stories, as <hi>Antoninus, Lippomanus, Onuphrius, Surius, Sedulius,</hi> and men of the like temper in their faces as <hi>Nabuchadnezzars</hi> image was in his feet, which neither had good mettall, nor yet hung together: of whom we may say, as <hi>Tully</hi> of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> whom he cals <hi>Patrem Historie, The Father of Histories;</hi>

               <p n="12">12 By the most ancient and most approued Historians, we affirme and iustifie, that the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> continued long as vassals and subiects to the Romane Emperours; yea when they were Christians, they were at their election and at their commandement. Which is cleare, as well by the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as by their mutuall Epistles that passed betweene them: wherein the Bishops euer gaue titles of honour and superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to the Emperours, and humbled themselues by submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue petitions and requests. For this I may referre the iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reader to the first Tome of the Councels, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the second, to <hi>Eusebius, Theodoret,</hi> yea and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the Great,</hi> who all concurre in this passage, without any iust exception to my knowledge.</p>
               <p n="13">13 By the same Antiquitie and Authoritie it is preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that the Emperours called the Councels, summoned the Bishops with words of Soueraigntie, prescribed them limits of time, place, and matters to be handled. If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Rome</hi> did any thing, it was by petition and humble
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:177094:141"/> supplication before, dutifull thanks and gratulation after; without all pretence of the present power now claimed and defended by the Romane Catholickes, as if no Councell may be summoned, but onely by the bellowing of the Popes bull. Which challenge is meere new, and flatly Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Reade <hi>Eusebius in vita Constantini,</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> of the calling of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, and the Emperours Christian behauiour in exhorting the Bishops, composing differences, allaying contentions, perswading of peace, and managing euen the matters of faith and religion, in offering <hi>Codicem diuinum,</hi> the <hi>booke of God,</hi> by his Imperiall maiestie. A thing now so abhorrent from the Romane eares in these later dayes, that though they know it as well as we, yet will they not beleeue it, or at least confesse it, to saue their soules.</p>

But they may more truly say and plainly, that more heresies haue bene and yet are supported and maintained by Traditions then by the written word, which is the fire that consumeth the chaffe of mens deuices, and the onely <hi>Malleus haereticorum,</hi> the onely hammer,<note place="margin">Ierem. 23.29.</note> that either bruiseth the hearts of men and softeneth them to repentance, or breaketh them in peeces, and beareth them to death through obstinacie in misbeleefe.

Which though they haue nothing but truth, yet containe they not all truth in the Romanists conceipt, and therefore (as is said) their defect must be supplied with these Traditions. The Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall are of the same accompt with the written Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and registred Decrees of the Councels and Popes: which are sometimes reckened to be equall with the foure Euangelists,<note place="margin">Campion. rat. 4.</note> and Canonicall Scriptures; euen Trent, with the best former, and the last with the first Decretals; and so by consequent all these Ecclesiasticall Traditions are as good as the Apostolicall or Diuine, &amp; so as the written word of God.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Our difference with the Romanists stands not in this, whether the diuine and Apostolicall Traditions be equall with the Scriptures; we will confesse it. For we doubt not, but that the Apostles preached nothing but the substance thereof is written: and let our aduersaries directly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiuely proue, that Christ or his Apostles taught any of those things which they obtrude vpon the Church, (though not written,) we will receiue them as the word of God. But this they shall be neuer able to do: and therefore we deferre the triall of all truth to the certaine and vndoubted written word, that is, the Canonicall Scriptures of God. In which case we may be bold to say, euen with the Conuenticle of Trent it selfe,<note place="margin">Sessio. 4.</note> that we <hi>receiue and reuerence</hi> with equall <hi>pious affection, all that Christ or his Apostles taught by word of mouth, whether they concerne faith or manners,</hi> euen as well as the Scriptures themselues. For certainly they spake nothing contrarie to that which is written.

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:177094:151"/> kam, and cleane contrary to the Scriptures. We will not be gulled with these vnder any pretence: proue them Christs, we accept them with all humilitie; if you cannot proue them, we reiect them with all seueritie.

But for their conuenience or near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto the similitude of truth, there may be difference, some nearer, some farther off. The proofes in this case of such moment, must be demonstratiue, and <hi>luce clariores,</hi> as cleare as the Sunne.

               <p n="16">16 First to colour the worst, they haue some which they call Traditions and are not, for as they be plainly in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:177094:154"/> or by such necessary collection and deduction drawne from thence, that they may iustly challenge their prerogatiue from the Scriptures, as many of the Fathers, and namely <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> taketh them, <hi>Traditiones Patrum ex Prophetis, &amp; lege,</hi>

For otherwise,</hi> we should need neither Christ to be with vs, to the end of the world, nor the holy Ghost to inspire vs, nor Pastors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to teach vs, yea we should be worse prouided for then the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, Neque bene esset consultum simplicitèr Ecclesiae. <hi>Neither plainly should the Church haue bene well prouided for.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="17">17 Vnder this colourable pretence they haue so peeced their Traditions to the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> as they repaired <hi>Theseus</hi> ship, 'till it put the Philosophers to their dispute whether it were the old ship, or a new. For so haue the Romanists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded their traditions with the Scriptures, as that they know not which is old, which is new, which in time they would haue made like a Capuchins cloke that is neuer but one, though it haue not one rag of the first left. Howbeit of these Scripture Traditions, there is neither scruple nor question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and them. Neither in deed can these by them be called Traditions at all.</p>
               <p n="18">18 For they hold Traditions to be truths not contained in the Scriptures, which causeth their distinction of the word of
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:177094:155"/> God written, and not written. Whereby their egregious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse doth most euidently appeare.

But when the sophistications and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd conceits of the Romane Church were discried and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and the true sence of the Scriptures by diligent enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie boulted out; then they had no other shift but impudently to hold the conclusions, without their ancient premises, and to dispute like skilfull Lawyers, from <hi>Titulo non scripto, lege nulla, paragrapho nusquam</hi> or <hi>nunquam:</hi> Lawes vnmade, words vnwritten, learning neuer heard of, neither any where to be found.</p>
               <p n="19">19 For example, take any of <hi>Soto</hi> or Doctor <hi>Kellisons</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or almost any other that are controuerted betweene the Court of Rome and the Church of God, and obserue which of them hath not had the pretence of Scripture vpon Scripture, text vpon text, and Apostle vpon Prophet to proue them. Yet now they are only Traditions not written. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is notoriously euinced, that when they alledged Scripture for these, and many other, either they did it out of grosse and palpable ignorance, speaking that which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not, and that must be their best excuse; or else out of a desperate hardnesse of heart and wilfull malice, falsly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, and damnably abusing the holy Scriptures of God, for matters not at all contained in them, and that vpon their knowledge.</p>
               <p n="20">20 The other is, that in stead of the onely written word of God, of which there is no doubt or scruple, they substitute and suborne, vncertaine, vnknowne, various, temporary and transitory Traditions in their roome.

Bring vs any Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thus fortified, thus assured as the Scriptures are, we will meete them, receiue them, imbrace them and lay them next our hearts to obserue them. Wherefore though we can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confesse this to be an excellent proofe, yet we hope to find as good, if not better.</p>
               <p n="28">28 The Doctor demandeth farther: May they pretend the authoritie of their owne new Church? But first, saith he, they must proue their Church to be the true Church. That is not to do, if we had spoken to men that had not lost their cares. I could wish for their owne sakes, they could as well proue themselues to be the chaste spouse of Christ, as we haue done on our owne behalfe. For we know our selues to be the true Church of Christ by the Scriptures, as a chaste matron is knowne by her husband. And we know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the Church, as the husband is knowne by his wife. His blessings vpon her, his loue toward her, her faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards him, are sufficient demonstrations to vs that we are his spouse; sufficient motiues to him, to continue our gracious and glorious husband. This can they neuer know, that vilifie his word, and oppose themselues vnto the law of Christ, as the Courtly Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Yet the Doctor proceedeth to fight with his owne shadow, and play with his owne imaginations. <hi>They will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Scriptures,</hi> saith he, <hi>but these will not helpe them for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the whole testifie of the whole, nor any part one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or if they do it, it should not. For euery part vnto a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher or vnbeleeuer, is as much doubted of as the whole. So that the whole cannot testifie for a part, nor any part for the whole.</hi> We deale not with Philosophers or vnbeleeuers, or else they confesse themselues to be both. But Philosophers and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers do no more beleeue the Church, then they do the Scriptures; and then what hath the Doctor said, that maketh not as much against the knowledge of their Church to be
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:177094:157"/> the true Church, as of the Scriptures to be the true Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? But all that he hath said is palpably false. For the new Testament approueth the old, and the old doth demonstrate the new. The new often alledgeth the old, and the old fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth that which is done in the new. Enough to conuince a very Infidell.</p>
               <p n="30">30 But more then this. The old Testament was in the hands of the enemies of the Gospell. The Gospell was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the Iews enemies. These fortified both by strength of opposition, and preserued both for their owne defence and satisfaction. And many of these accorded each with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, induced, without standing vpon the authoritie of any outward Church, by the due conference of the Scriptures. Heretickes haue refused both, when they haue made against them: and the true beleeuers strengthened their cause by them. Againe, heretickes alledged them when they could draw any similitude of truth from them; and the Christian Catholiks euidently conuinced all gainstanders out of them. And this we haue out of approued Ecclesiasticall history, and monuments of the most ancient Churches. This is a farre stronger and more euident reason, to proue the Scriptures to be Scriptures, then that they were (forsooth) preserued and approued by the Romane Church. What will they answer if we tell them, that the Scriptures were before the Romane Church was? and that neither all, nor some, nor any part of them was more committed to her charge, then to any other Church to which they were written, as to them one, to the Corinthians two, and so to others; but all for all, that all <hi>through patience and comfort of them might haue hope.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="32">32 But I rather answer, that the Scriptures are sufficient to demonstrate their owne authoritie; not by their phrase and style onely (which the Doctor derides of all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for that, as he saith, <hi>The profane man accounteth the style base and barbarous,</hi>) but by many reasons beside. Yet euen the very style, so solemne, so graue, so stately; the matter so full of iustice, holinesse and sanctification: the histories so true in the iudgement of all: the mysteries so deepe, the maiestie so great, as that vnto any indifferent iudgement, in all excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies it is not onely in deed, but in shew also the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate and absolute book in the world. Yet beside all this (as the Doctor saith well) the Antiquitie of the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other bookes: their preseruation so many thousand yeares, through so many dangers, so long captiuities, such potent and malicious enemies that sought to destroy them: the conformitie and vniformitie of the bookes one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which were indited and translated, in diuers times, at sundry places, by seuerall persons, without contradiction, or one dangerous position. All which if the Romane Church may auow, I see not why any Christian Catholicke may not do the same: and then all these are in equall ballance, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to vs as to them.</p>
               <p n="33">33 But we will come yet nearer them, and tell them that the Scriptures manifest themselues, as we discerne hony by the taste, the Sunne by his light, muske by the smell, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke by the eare, Physicke by the working, our friend by his loue, our parents by their naturall affection.

That of all the Apostles he had the sword, and handled it; that his faith should not faile; that he conuerted should strengthen the brethren; that all Christs lambes and sheepe were committed to him, as vnto the vniuersall Pastor of all soules: that he moued the election of another in the place of <hi>Iudas;</hi> that he spake first in the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:177094:160"/> Councell of the Apostles? All these Scriptures haue bene al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for <hi>Peters</hi> primacy; yet now it is but a Tradition that is not written; for indeed those Scriptures proue it not, they know.

Such is the strength of truth, that sometimes in the dayes of darknesse, it breaketh forth and giueth light vnto some more vnpartiall hearts, who without preiudicate affections, search diligently for it till they find it; and when they haue found it, dare make open profession of it. I cannot forbeare to ioyne <hi>Erasmus</hi> his conceite,<note place="margin">Epistola ad Sadoletum.</note> which I may adde vnto the former mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest passages, which though he seemeth to vtter merrily, yet he meant it verily, &amp; so I take it: <hi>Constat nullum esse locum in diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis voluminibus, qui permittit inuocari Sanctos, nisi fortè huc tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere placet quod Diues in Euangelio opem imploret Abrahe:</hi>
                  <q>It is euident, that there is no place in the Diuine volumes, which (he saith not, teacheth, commandeth, or counselleth) but that so much as <hi>permitteth Saints to be inuocated, except</hi> a man would wrest that in the Gospell, where <hi>Diues</hi> calleth vpon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
                  </q> A fit <hi>Moecenas</hi> for such learning, and Patron for such idolatrie. But <hi>Erasmus</hi> is but <hi>semi-Christianus,</hi> a moitie of a Christian with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and therefore this will be taken but for a <hi>Lucian</hi> floute. Yet if it be a bourd, it is a true bourd, as the Northerne prouerbe saith.</p>
               <p n="42">42 This passage might be amplified by the article of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, auricular confession, and many others: but these are suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to demonstrate our aduersaries fearefull abusing of the word, by alledging Scriptures euen against their owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, for such things as themselues call and hold to be Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and confesse are not to be found in the Scriptures. What is this but to draw the Scriptures to their owne sence, not to subiect their owne iudgement to the Scriptures? Which dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing may sufficiently detect our aduersaries care and conscience, or rather, neither care nor conscience, in seeking and finding the way of truth. But that which is worse, if worse may be, they are contented to rest themselues, and delude gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Christians with Traditions that haue no ground of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability in the Scriptures, or shew of authoritie, whereon a deuout soule might relie and repose his faith, with hope to hold fast without fainting or falling. If they departed, but
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:177094:162"/> from Mount Sion to mount Nebo neare vnto the land of of Promise, it were somewhat tollerable, though hope be neuer so good as fruition; or if they would trauell from mount Nebo to Sion, we would ioyne with them, for this were from the worst to the better. But to bring vs from the hills from whence commeth our saluation,<note place="margin">Psal.</note> these foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which can neuer be moued, to the marrishes and boggs, quicke sands, and blacke mud, or myerie clay of mens Traditions, where no firme footing can be found, no ground-worke can be laid, this is apparently from better to worse; that giueth no hope, but menaceth desperate, deadly, and vnrecouerable damnation. Better haue Traditions with some probable shew of Scriptures, then to bring them and enforce them without all sauour or sap of authoritie. Yet is it hard to iudge whether is the better.</p>
               <p n="43">43 For except they be either expresly in the Scriptures, or by necessarie deduction without wresting or writhing may be concluded from them, they are without all credit for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of faith, or perswasion in matter of religion. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our aduersaries haue for this an expedit way. For we need not diue into the deep ocean of <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> nor delue into the bowels of the earth for this base mettall, nor ascend vnto the secrets of long since passed times, if we will be ruled by the Romane Court. For if they haue them, and the Pope allow them, they are thereby approued without all question, as if they were neuer so old, and could be directly brought from the Apostles mouthes or pennes. And when they are thus had and enioyed, yet they may be changed and altered, yea disanulled and abrogated at the Popes owne pleasure.<note place="margin">Contra Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. l. 4.

               <p n="44">44 See how fitly a wittie and ingenious Poet of our time hath likened the word of God to the Gnomon of a Sun Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, these Traditions to a clooke, &amp; the Pope to a wethercock. As himselfe turneth with the wind, so he can set the clocke at his pleasure: And it greeues him that the Dials Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is so guided by the Sunne that it can not erre, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will obscure truth, do the weather-cocke what he can.</p>
               <p n="45">45 We are not ignorant of the frailtie of mans nature, how subiect it is to mutabilitie and change. And we as well know by long and great experience, (howsoeuer the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists, Schoolemen, and other the Popes creatures flatter) that the Bishop of Rome is but a man, a fraile and sinfull man, often times a most wicked and damnable man; yet all Christianitie must hang vpon this one hinge, as heauen rested vpon <hi>Atlas</hi> shoulders. No Scriptures, but of his allowing; no interpretation but of his deuising; no Traditions but of his approuing; and therefore no faith; no religion but of his making. Yet all this is not enough to support the decaying walls of tottering Babylon, but we must haue also new stuffe added, euer prouided it be such as is vsed in the Romane Church, admitted by the Popes authority,<note place="margin">Nicol.

And this though it seeme absurd, yet they will make it good in the handling: or as <hi>Benedictus Parisiensis,</hi> that saith, <hi>Balaams Asse signifieth the Church, and the Pope Balaam that sitteth thereon,</hi> and so may keepe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feast of <hi>Asinarus,</hi> where Saint <hi>Francis</hi> may be the

Surely they are of the ancient stocke of the <hi>Bruti,</hi> or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani,</hi> as <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> applied them. But Traditions need no Asse to carrie them, they haue life and actiuitie sufficient in themselues. <hi>Quid enim aliud sunt Traditiones, quàm viuum quoddam, Euangelium?</hi> For what are Traditions <hi>(saith a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall)</hi> but a certaine liuing Gospell? As much to say, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are so old, they are decrepite they can not go nor helpe themselues. But Traditions are nimble as tumblers, and can trauaile like lustie <hi>Iuuentus,</hi> or a landloper ouer the world. <hi>They are the liuing Gospell, the Scriptures are but dead letters.</hi> For these we striue as the two mothers before <hi>Salomon,</hi>

We thanke God our triall stands before one wiser then <hi>Salomon,</hi> we doubt not but to hold our liuing child which is the Scriptures; let them take their dead child who are the mother or damme therof, we wil not deuide the word of God into <hi>Scriptum &amp; non Scriptum,</hi> written and not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. This is to kill the liuing word, the word of life. We are well contented to leaue them their owne vnto themselues, for in their owne conceipts they cannot be bettered. For some one of them may be as good as the whole Scripture, yea rather then faile, better.</p>
               <p n="47">47 The Strumpet Babylon taketh all the Scriptures insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to saluation. Not the one halfe, nay I may truly say and safely, not one iota of her doctrine, now by the reformed Churches reproued, hath any ground from the Scriptures of God at all.<note place="margin">Hosius ibid.</note> But one Tradition <hi>is almost enough to saue a soule</hi> forsooth, and that is the signe of the Crosse, especially if it be skilfully made: <hi>Beginning from the top of the crowne or the forehead</hi> (at the least) <hi>to the nauell, and then from the left shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the right,</hi> and this is a Crosse in <hi>folio:</hi> as that ouer the lips when a man yaunes, is in <hi>decimo sexto:</hi> and prouided also it be done with three <hi>fingers to signifie the Trintie,</hi> and then to a <hi>rude countrie fellow who for the grosnes of his vnderstanding, is not able to attaine higher in other points, Vel hoc illi propè solum ad

               <p n="48">48 But this is not all. For as the admission of this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Tradition is so supereminently great, so is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereof as superlatiuely dangerous.

What a strange vsurpation is this of a Cardinall, that can after all the Doctors, Schoolemen and Popes, make a new sinne against the holy Ghost, which was neuer heard of in this world, nor shall euer be censured in the world to come?</p>
               <p n="49">49 The summe of all is this; high and profound myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Diuinitie are called into question, which concerne the glorie of that dreadfull Maiestie whom we all pretend to worship in truth and veritie. We appeale to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as vnto the written will of the Sonne of God, to trie our claime to the mercies of God his Father, and the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of life promised to vs, purchased by him. Herein we are refused, this euidence is despised, vilified, reiected. Our aduersaries call and crie for Traditions, left without writing, either by our Sauiour or by his Apostles, as they pretend, but can neuer proue: or by the customes of their Church, which perhaps they may shew, but we haue no reason to allow. Proue them to proceed from such diuine authoritie, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, accept them, reuerence them, and embrace them with both our armes, and lay them to our hearts. Our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries will not admit any such condition.</p>
               <p n="50">50 Say what we can, if <hi>Rome</hi> get the maister doome, what the triple Crowne hath, that we must hold (sauing the gold and precious stones thereof): what it refuseth, that we must detest, with implicite faith and blind obedience, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking question, or demanding reason; as if we had heads without braines, and carkasses without hearts, meere blocks without sense, and worse then the horse or mule that haue
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:177094:164"/> no vnderstanding. But (deare Christian Reader) as we consist of bodies and soules, and haue the light of reason and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vnderstanding, whereby we are enabled to lay claime vnto the inheritance of light and life: so we are resolued not to be remoued from the truth of God reuealed in his word, with any blast of <hi>Romes</hi> false doctrine, who withhold the truth of God in vnrighteousnesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18. Iude 13.</note> and dayly fome out their owne shame, to the great dishonour of Gods maiestie, and the vnspeakable scandall of his Saints.</p>
               <p n="51">51 Wherefore let the Romanists pretend what omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie they please in their pompous Prelate, and infoist what Traditions they will into the title of the word of God, or tye the holy Ghost to the Popes elbow or chaire stoope, as his Parasites either vainly imagine, or else against their owne consciences affirme; yet we know and haue proued, that after the publication of the Scriptures and deceasse of the Apostles, nothing may bind our absolute obedience in the substance of our faith and religion, but onely they. And this we conclude, not out of our owne selfwils, but we build it vpon the ancient Fathers, and receiue from most appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> which should bind them fastest that pretend it most, as our aduersaries haue done, though now they leaue off to enquire of old yeares, or to be guided by gray haires, and onely betake themselues to the moderne Tyrant, and the policie of his Court, as if the blessed Spirit of God were at his commandement.</p>
               <p n="52">52 <q>But if we aske our Fathers, Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> wil tell vs, that <hi>Qui propria loquuntur, falsò praetendunt Spiritū sanctum,</hi> As long as they speake their owne, they falsly pretend the holy Ghost.</q> Both Papists and Anabaptists (whom in this case I cannot separate) are stifled, and their breath stopt, by the same Father, who defendeth Gods cause and ours against them:<note place="margin">De sancto &amp; adorando Spiritu.</note>
                  <hi>Si quid praeter Euangelium sub titulo Spiritus obtrudatur, ne credamus: quia sicut Christus est finis Legis, ita Spiritus Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelij:</hi> If any thing be thrust vpon vs beside the Gospel, vnder the title of the holy Ghost, let vs neuer beleeue it: for as Christ was the end of the Law, so was the holy Spirit of the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:177094:164"/> Gospell. As who should say, As nothing should be added to the Law and Prophets (which is the old Testament) after Christ came, who was the fulfilling of the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: so nothing, as necessary to saluation, should be added to the Euangelists and Apostles, that is, to the bookes of the new Testament, when the holy Ghost had done writing by them. Which we shall easily perceiue, if we well obserue the bodie of both Testaments with their substantiall parts. For the old Testament hath the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the histories of the Church, moralities for conuersation, and prophesies, chiefly of Christ our Sauiours first coming in humilitie, and yet not without intermixture of each of these within o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So the new Testament though in quantitie shorter, yet in qualitie both plainer and more eminent, hath the law of Christ in the foure Euangelists, the historie of the first Church in the Acts of the Apostles, instructiōs both for faith &amp; manners in the Epistles, and finally the prophesies of after-times, vntill the second comming of the Lord Iesus in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; yet not without intertexture of euery in each, that the harmonie of the Scriptures may be seene, and the constancie of the Spirit of God made knowne vnto all fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing generations. From these nothing may be taken; to these nothing may be added, without deepe sacriledge, and high blasphemie, or both in either. Therefore to conclude, all Traditions, especially if they neuer so litle oppose these Scriptures, or vary from them with the least contrarietie, howsoeuer they may be tendred, yet may they not be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; and may be reiected with the same facilitie they were receiued or admitted.</p>

               <p n="2">2 Such haue bene the later Councels of a few passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, congregated vpon faction, ouerruled by preiudicate affection, and concluded to the preiudice of the truth, onely for the support of the kingdome of Antichrist, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his tempestuous sea.

               <p n="3">3 This mysterie of iniquitie, simple Christians know not, and therefore are deceiued.

                  <hi>that shall reason or dispute against it after it hath once determined: That all Nationall or Prouinciall Councels must stoope to the authoritie of an Vniuersall, without all stop or ambiguitie;</hi> he could not but admire their great authoritie. And in very truth if this were spoken of those oldest and best Councels, we would conniue much for the innocencie of the times, the grauitie of the Bishops, and the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of both. But this is claimed for euery late Conuenticle, though neuer so partiall. As if the last Chapter of Trent, were as good as the first Councell of Nice; and <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth or fifth as good as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> in the Councell of the Apostles. Howbeit God knowes the case is exceedingly altered. For vpon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination we haue found that the first and best Councels haue not that credit with the Romanists which they pretend, neither are the later such as they may iustly commend, or we safely receiue without danger of miscariage, in chiefe articles of our faith.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The first, as hath bene proued, were called by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, maintained at their charge, protected by their armes, concluded by their approbations, the time and place assigned at their pleasure, whatsoeuer the Locusts or rather dogs of Rome, snarle or barke to the contrary. These later must be summoned onely by the Pope, appointed when he list, colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted where he please, onely he will be at no charge, as the Emperours were: marrie the Emperours as his vassals must giue the commers protection. He alone must be President, not so much moderating with learning and discretion, as ouer-ruling with power and authoritie, commanding with pride and insolencie, and concluding them with shame and infamie, as wofull experience hath made euident to all the Christian world. Whereas Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his time could say, that sometimes old Councels were amended by the new, former by later; we may iustly say, and proue it true, that since this partialitie bare sway in the Church, the old haue bene cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, not corrected by the new; and the former by the later, to the subuersion of faith, and ouerthrow of good manners.</p>

Trent.</note>5 If we should exemplifie this by particulars, but in the late Councell of Lateran vnder <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and the last of Trent, they would yeeld abundant matter to iustifie this asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the former, besides all the absurdities therein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, this blasphemie was there heard and vncontrolled, that the Pope had <hi>Potestatem super omnes potestates, tam in coelo quàm in terra:</hi> Power ouer all powers both in heauen and in earth. In the later, so many grosse errors determined, as if of set purpose they would not onely reforme nothing that all the world saw to be amisse, but so maintained all the corruptions that fretted the conscience of many a Christian, like a very Gangrene, that in many Countries and Vniuersities, yea some of them otherwise Catholicke, they are yet exploded and condemned.<note place="margin">Contra Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium. l. 2.</note> Cardinall <hi>Hosius</hi> to shew how in some cases the former Councels were amended by the later, doth beautifie it with this instance. <hi>There is</hi> (saith he) <hi>a Canon Apostolicall, that a Presbyter which is a fornicator, should be deposed. This in the Councell of Gangren, as it is alledged by Gratian, is amended, and the paine mitigated.</hi> Surely a very great commendation; to take away a seuere punishment, for so grosse a sinne, that had a greater censure in the law of nature. But out of question this mitigation was vpon good occasion and discretion appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For if in these later ages all Priestly fornicators had bene deposed, there would scarcely haue bene Curats to haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at their altars, except <hi>si non castè, tamen cantè,</hi> if not chastly yet charily had saued them harmlesse.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If these be their reformations, what then are their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations? Obserue without preiudice the passages of most later Councels (not to speake of the African nor the Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) that haue bene fiue or sixe hundred yeares after Christ, and marke whether the primacy, or supremacy of the Bishop of Rome, or the honour of that turbulent Sea, the Popes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, vnder pretence of voyages against the Saracens or Turkes, the recouery of the holy land, and sepulcher of our Sauiour, with such like impostures,<note place="margin">Furfur quaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam, sed pro potu venie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam.</note> haue not bene chiefly ventilated in them; vnder what pretence soeuer they were called, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an errand for one thing, but they intended another.
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:177094:166"/> Against all which, we haue iust cause to except.</p>

I also professe, that there be truly and properly seuen Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the new Law, instituted by Iesus Christ our Lord, and vnto the saluation of mankind, although they be not all necessarie for euery singular man; that is to say, Baptisme, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme vnction, Orders, and Matrimony; and that they conferre grace. Moreouer, I do receiue and admit all the receiued and approued rites of the Catholique Church, about the solemne administration of the foresaid Sacraments. All and euery thing concerning originall sinne, and of Iustification, which were defined and published in the holy Councell of Trent, I embrace and receiue. I withall professe, that in the Masse there is offered vnto God a true proper and propitiatorie Sacrifice, for the quicke and dead: and that in the most holy Sacrament of the Eucharist, there is truly, really, and substantially the body and blood, together with the soule and Diuinitie of our Lord Iesus Christ: and that there is made a conuersion of the whole substance of the bread into the body, and the whole substance of wine, into the blood, which conuersion the Catholique Church calleth Transsubstantiation.</q>

Finally, yet once suppose that we would yeeld as much to all the Councels past, as hath bene or can be practised or required; shall all their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons stand vnuiolable? and may we rest vpon either the old Councels, and new Conuenticles, and that with the Popes consent, without change or alteration?

So the Romanists murther the fathers by their maledictions (as before is proued,) &amp; then clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with their apparell, to deceiue the ouer credulous and weake Christians. If a Bankrupt be brought in a faire Citizens gowne, and with the name of an Alderman, it would be a shrewd temptation to a plaine meaning man to giue him cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: Or if a Client should bring into an open court, old eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences without date, that haue hand &amp; seale, and are truly his Ancestors, so accepted and taken, and all this without doubt or denyall; would not this dant and amate his aduersarie, and giue him good cause at least to feare, if not quite to despaire of his action? I trow it would.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Yet for all these faire shewes, a wise man will looke eare he leape, and trie ere he trust. He will be resolued of the person, before he take his word, or his bond either. And a graue and sage Counsellour will reade the euidences, and see whether the thing in question be conueyed by that deed, or if it be, whether it may lawfully be so or not; or if it be so, &amp; may be so, yet he will spie for enterlinings, or prie for rasures, or cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with Counterpaines, or search the Rolles in the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie or monuments in the Tower, before he yeeld his Clients cause. So must we do with our aduersaries, when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Fathers. They may tell me this is such a Father, and it may not be the man; shall I take a knight (as they say) of the Post, or a counterfeit cranke for a worthy Alderman in the Citie of God? They may produce ancient euidences, that by their style, and other probable circumstances, may be proued to be the old Fathers indeed. Must we take them at the first fight, and throw vp our cause before we make better tryall of the deed? We must obserue whether the case in question be there concluded. If it be, whether it may so lawfully be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as that no iust exception may be admitted against it; or if there be no exception in respect of the maner of conueyance,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:177094:172"/> yet look whether there be not enterlining, or rasures, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it agree with ancient copies in vnsuspected Libraries. For by any one of these, a good cause may be ill ouerthrowne, and an vnrecouerable losse may fall vpon an innocent and harmelesse soule.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Our aduersaries the Romanists (howsoeuer <hi>Bellarmine</hi> calleth them block-heads) as they are passing wittie and dexterous in all craftie deuices, and care not how they cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuent poore soules, deuout perhaps, but yet blinded and amazed with superstition: so they ceasse not to put them in daily practise, and are not ashamed in the noone day of the Gospell, to offer them to the world, as if all men were as blind buzzards, as they make themselues.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That excellent Father <hi>Athanasius</hi> was accused before a Iudge of incontinencie with her that was present, and laid the fact most impudently to the innocent Fathers charge. The Harlot not sparing her selfe withall,<note place="margin">Ruffinus hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor. l. 1. c. 17.</note> vrged the libell, as she had bene instructed; such circumstances were produced, as that it possessed the Court with probabilitie at the least, that the good Father was slandered with a matter of truth: vntill <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus</hi> the good Bishops Chaplaine taking vpon him the person of the accused,<note place="margin">Presbytero suo.</note> asked (as if himselfe had bene the man) whether she knew him to haue bene in her house, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer he had carnally knowne her: She not knowing the Father, but imagining this to be the man, auouched her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation as strongly to his face, as if he had bene <hi>Athanasius</hi> indeed, whom she accused. By which she was conuicted of calumnie, the good Fathers aduersaries confounded, and his innocencie by Gods prouidence, and this Christian policie, worthily cleared, though he not deliuered from his enemies malice. It thus often fareth with the Romane strumpet, who accuseth the holy Fathers, as accessary to her fornications, and that with such impudencie and importunity, that a right iust man may be easily deluded, but a friend to the Fathers wil detect her deceite, and saue their credit from her shamelesse accusation.</p>

                  <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> hath laboured well in this kind: and hath set downe many meanes and occasions, why bookes are falsely intituled, some honest, some dishonest, as he saith. Not to speake of those which he calleth honest, the dishonest are principally two-fold; either to play the knaues in the cousening the ignorant, or to broach their owne errors vnder tides of credite: and this may and hath bene attempted by the Authors themselues. Howbeit this also may be done by others, and that out of error, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by sufficient warning is giuen, not to beleeue that all is gold which glistereth with the glorious shew of an ancient Fathers name, but to beware lest a snake be hid vnder greene grasse. We receiue this cautele from our aduersaries, both rules and practise, and therefore haue iust cause to look about vs. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit these are such common trickes, that they may impose as well vpon our aduersaries as vs, and so we may be all decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But there are others which are so appropriate to the Church of Rome, that they onely inuent them, to circumuent vs, and to outface a good cause, with pretended countenance of ancient Fathers, and that vnder these shadowes.</p>

These either haue bene written in times somewhat el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by heretickes, or such impostors, and for aduantage are now admitted for classicall authors in the Church of Rome: or they are inuentions of idle Monkes, that haue little else to do, and layed a while to rust and canker in vaults, or old wals, and being found on the sudden (forsooth) of them that hid them, or a generation or two after, are produced for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, as if they were elder then <hi>Methusalem,</hi> and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten long before their fathers were borne; and this were a miracle.</p>

               <p n="13">13 To prosecute each of these in their particulars, though it may seeme pertinent to this place, yet for feare of length partly, and because none but scholers are like to make search for them: I would referre them to the authors before named, especially to that of Maister <hi>Cooke;</hi> who hath most exactly searched into this argument.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:177094:175"/> one threed of their spinning, and made a prey by Antichrist the child of perdition. There he may find an answer out of our aduersaries owne mouthes and pennes, to very neare two parts or more, very neare the one halfe of all that is brought for priuate Masse, Reall presence, Transsubstantiation, Inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and worship of Saints, Purgatorie, Pilgrimage, Popes supremacie, Pardons, Originall sinne, Iustification, Free will, Prayers in an vnknowne tongue, halfe Communion, Merit, seuen Sacraments, and whatsoeuer else they call Traditions. For the chiefe and most pregnant proofes the Romanists haue for these things, are all fished out of such puddles, as if they had so many ancient Fathers; when God knowes they are not the progeny of the Fathers, or the true children of the Church.</p>
               <p n="14">14 I may adde vnto all this, that the true Fathers, in their vndoubted and knowne workes, by new Editions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Manuscripts are so corrupted and sophisticated with additions, subtractions, purgations, and almost euacuations, that it is as hard at first sight to know an ancient Doctor of the Church, as it is for a child to know his father neare the Popes Court. Where the Romanists talke of Doctors and Fathers, they are for the most part no other then hath bene said, they vse them no otherwise, as you shall proue.</p>
               <p n="15">15 It may possibly be, that out of a very Father indeed, so taken and approued, our aduersaries may sometimes find a sentence that wil make shew for them. Yet looke narrowly to it, and you shall find it some priuate opinion of his, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed, or at least contradicted by other, or mistaken by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or misapplied, or misconstrued, or such a fault as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excused, and if the father were liuing, would reforme it himselfe.

               <p n="16">16 There was a tyrannicall King called in Hebrue <hi>Abad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and in Greeke <hi>Apollyon,</hi> that in a desperate cause, made

He presseth into the field diuers choice men, valiant souldiers, furnished with their armour of proofe; yet because his claime is wrongfull, and his quarrell naught, they go no further then enforced, they fight with no courage, and are ready to turne their weapons against him that presseth them for his enemy: for he is not their liege Lord, nor they his subiects. The Tyrant flyeth, yet abating no malice, returneth againe with a rascall rout, and a forlorne hope, of out-lawes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>starts, boyes, and loose desperate companions, with shels for shields, with spits for swords, and will venture a new assault against the puissant armies of the great Prince. Wil not a wise Counseller rather thinke him out of his wits, then encourage him in his enterprise, or giue him comfort against the day of battell? This is the very case of Antichrist, who daily defieth the hoast of the liuing God. He hath pressed the Scriptures and oppressed them, when he long kept them in an vnknown tongue; enforced the Fathers by wresting them into his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, against their wils. They had good armour and weapons, but they would not vse them against the Prince of peace. By these this Tyrant could neuer come to his purpose; he flyeth the field; he returneth with his <hi>Abdias</hi> and his <hi>Martial,</hi> with scullions and kitchin boyes, perhaps with a few ancient and graue men among, but cut and maimed, because they refused his wicked designes. For this he searcheth vaults, plucketh downe old wals, ouerthroweth pillars, and perhaps spareth not to farme priuies, to find out such weapons as may serue for shew, but shall neuer stand in stead for proofe.</p>
               <p n="17">17 It fareth with them as with a man in danger of drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who catcheth at shadowes, which cannot helpe him, or thornes and briers, which rather hurt him.

For vntil the heresies of the Romane Church were publikly and resolutely, not onely by preaching, but by writing called into question, the Fathers writings were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken almost of euery man one from another, at second hand, few saw them themselues in their owne likenesse. Neither was it easie for them who contended about great mysteries of faith, to make any diligent search in the discouering of these impostures. In which kind notwithstanding, <hi>Erasmus</hi> and some others following this businesse with sharpe sense, layd open the counterfeits and forged Fathers, to more exact view. Vntil then, some of ours took them as they found them without scruple, and alledged them against <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> brought them against truth. Our difference was, that we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the best and most certaine by the Scriptures; they vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the worst, as binding proofes for their errors, whereby they mis-led their disciples, and sought to outface their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites. But now seeing the most of these haue bin examined by the light, and are found ouer light to sway or ouerbeare any controuersie of moment; let them be discarded as they deserue, on all hands, in point of controuersie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat supplies the Romanists haue made for <hi>Scriptures, Councels</hi> and <hi>Fathers,</hi> is shortly, but I hope sufficiently, deliuered. Rather then they should not seeme to runne with foure feet, like beasts, as they are, hauing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced all ancient historians with their histories,<note place="margin">1. King. 3.20.</note> they haue againe prouided to put a dead child into the liuing childs roome; and therefore haue coyned old wiues tales, and lying Legends, which are the drowsie dreames of Monks and Friers, the very fruites of idlenesse, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and ignorance of Gods truth, as is confessed by one of their best friends,<note place="margin">Canus loc. cō. l. 11. c. 6.</note>
                  <hi>Ab hominibus otiosis fictae, à corruptis ingenijs versatae:</hi> Fained by idlers, and perused by corrupt wits. And lest they should seeme to neglect in this purueyance either Laitie or Clergie, they haue prouided for both.</p>
               <p n="2">2 For the Laitie, from whom all sacred histories of the Bible were immured and lockt vp in the darke dungeon of an vnknowne tongue, they prepared the stories of King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur</hi> of <hi>Brittaine</hi> and his Knights of the Round Table; the foure sonnes of <hi>Amon; Ʋalentine</hi> and <hi>Orson,</hi> with the like in prose: <hi>Beuis</hi> of <hi>Hampton, Adam Bel,</hi> and such like in meeter. Wherein many exploits and renowmed feats were descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be done, after deuout hearing of Masse, or orisons to our Ladie, or some other Saint, blessing themselues with the signe of the Crosse: by these meanes to instill the dregs of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and idolatry into ignorant hearts, with the delight of a vaine storie, which was more then halfe Scripture, to them that knew no better, nor other. I haue heard (but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not auouch my author, neither is it much materiall) that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:177094:178"/> some of the rude and vntaught borderers in the North (who would not beleeue that <hi>Thou shalt not steale</hi> was one of Gods commandements, but of King <hi>Henries</hi> new making) being reproued by a Gentleman for their barbarous ignorance in the points of Christianity, answered, They would gladly learne if any would teach them: and if they could get but a gude buike, they would haue it read in their Chappell though they had no Chaplaine. The Gentleman in meriment lendeth them <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Orson,</hi> they thankfully accept it, get it read, and hearken it deuoutly. In the beginning when the mother was destitute of helpe, deliuered in a forrest, a child surprised and nourished by a Beare, with other lamentable accidents that befell the distressed mother and her innocent babe, with crossings and blessings and lamentations, they fell a weeping, and strake their breasts in compassion, as if they had heard the storie of <hi>Ioseph</hi> making himselfe knowne to his brethren,<note place="margin">Gen. 45.2.</note> and tooke it for a very holy booke, if not for Scripture it selfe. But afterward hearing such fighting and scratching, such riuing and spoyling as followed in the tale, they returned with their booke, and asked in good sadnesse whether that were Gods buike or nay? for they found woe worke and fell fighting in it. Such was the dismall darknesse of that forlorne peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and such is it to this day, where they haue no better teaching. And what will not the <hi>brutish and foolish man</hi> beleeue, when he is vtterly ignorant of Gods truth,<note place="margin">2. Thes. 2.</note> which the wisest in the world forsaking, shall beleeue lyes?</p>
               <p n="3">3 For their Clergie they had their golden Legends, Saints liues, Festiuals, Martyrologies, <hi>Sermones discipuli,</hi> and such like wholesome books, which were commended to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, with prefaces, with prologues, with conclusions, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, promising, and warranting such benefite by them, as they neuer auouched by the word of God; whereas they are so full fraught with lyes and fables, that the more learned Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists are ashamed of some of them.<note place="margin">D. Harding.</note> Doctor <hi>Harding</hi> sayes of the golden Legend, <hi>Forsooth there is an old motheaten booke, wherein Saints liues are said to be contained: Certaine it is that among some true stories there be many vaine fables written.</hi>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:177094:179"/> But <hi>Viues</hi> that was no Protestant, said more then Maister <hi>Harding;</hi> who saith onely that it mattereth <hi>not who was the Author,</hi> for whosoeuer made it was <hi>ferrei frontis &amp; plumbei cordis, Of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

To allure the readers the better to buy this Legend, the reason of the name was giuen in the end of the booke, with the vse for the which it was written: <hi>It is called Golden, that like as gold excelleth all other mettals, so this excelleth all other bookes.</hi> And therefore is commended, &amp;c. A further proofe for the estimation of that booke may be produced out of a wil of a predecessor of mine, in the Vicaridge of Hallifax, dated <hi>anno Dom.</hi> 1477; who giueth no booke in his will, but one, and that is (as I take it) this. <hi>Item lego Ioanni Wilkinson fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio Roberti Wilkinson, vnum librum nominatum Legenda Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, si sit Presbyter: I bequeath to Iohn Wilkinson my brother Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert his sonne, one booke called the Legend of Saints, if he be a Priest.</hi> By which we may see, what store of books such a man in those dayes had; perhaps in all likelihood, he had not a better. For it is probable he would haue giuen him the best, or one of the best, hauing onely lay-men his executors, especially it being giuen on this condition, that he were a Priest. For otherwise it had bene too good for him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There is a whelpe of this haire called, the Festiuall, drawne as it were out of the <hi>Meditullio</hi> the marrow of this Legend, and hath onely the quintessence of the fables and liues thereof.<note place="margin">Prologue to the Festiual.</note> And it hath this prologue: <hi>In mine owne simple vnderstanding, I feele well, how it fareth, by other that be in the

But for many excuse them for defaut of bokies, and also by simplenesse of coming: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in helpe of such Clerkes this Treatise is drawne, out of Legen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da aurea, that he that list to studie therein, he shall find readie in it of all the principall feasts of the yeare, of each one a short sermon needfull for him to teach, and for other to learne; and for this Treatise speaketh of all the high feastes of the yeare, I will and pray that it be called Festiuall, &amp;c.</hi> This wise booke was compiled for the vse of Curats, in defect of better bookes: for supplie of skill in stead of sermons; for publicke Seruice, as needfull to be taught, as fruitfull to be learned; and all this of a brat of that <hi>Legenda aurea,</hi> so debased by Maister <hi>Harding,</hi> so bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by others. The same may be said of <hi>Ʋincentius Bcluacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis and Saint Anthony, quorum vterque non tam dedit operam vt res veras certásque describeret, &amp;c.</hi> saith <hi>Bishop Canus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Canus loc. cōmun. l. 11. cap. 6.</note> no friend of ours, <hi>who both endeuoured not so much to set downe things true and certaine, as to passe ouer nothing at all, that they found written in any shreads of paper.</hi> Yet one of these was a Saint, the other a copious writer, both approued long, and allowed in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Not a much vnlike iudgement giues Cardinall <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> of <hi>Simon Metaphrastes; whom Aloisius Liponanus</hi> hath translated, and put among his owne workes, and <hi>Surius</hi> hath his part of him also in his liues of Saints.<note place="margin">De scriptori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Ecclesiast</note> Thus saith the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: <q>Illud autem est obseruandum. This is to be obserued, that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories were written by Metaphrastes of the liues of Saints, to which he added much out of his owne wit, not as things were indeed done, but as they might haue bene done. For Metaphrastes addeth many conferences or Dialogues of Martyrs, and their persecutors, and some conuersions also of somae of the Pagans standing by, in such number as seeme incredible. And moreouer many miracles, and those very great of the ouerthrowes of temples and idols by occasion
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:177094:180"/> of the persecutors, whereof there is no mention in the ancient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And you may obserue this also in him, that some histories of Saints are added since he wrote.</q> Yet this very same Author is crept into the new reformed Romane Breuiarie as if he were some great and worthy author,<note place="margin">In festo Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colai. 6.

               <p n="6">6 What shall I tell you of <hi>Damasus,</hi> whose name hath long time giuen credit to <hi>Anastasius Bibliothecarius,</hi> as if he had written the liues of Popes, who liued <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 367, when the other was the author that liued <hi>Anno</hi> 850, and were almost 500 yeares betweene? And not onely <hi>Ambrose, Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Hierome, Augustine, Athanasius,</hi> and such like ancient and approoued authors, in their most suspected workes, but <hi>Gregories</hi> Dialogues, <hi>Hincmarus, Bonauenture,</hi> and such other haue their equall authority for lessons in their seruice. Yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vncertaine authors;<note place="margin">In Breui. Rō. reformat.</note>
                  <hi>a Sermon of Saint Augustine in maniscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi> yea <hi>Martyrologies,</hi> and I wot not whom: <hi>Platina,</hi> and one <hi>Barzo Clictoueus, Metaphrastes,</hi> and <hi>Friar Surius</hi> most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, new vpstart fellowes of our owne dayes, or our late fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and yet now make vp part of their ordinarie seruice in their Church; wherein they commit two desperate and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous euils.</p>
               <p n="7">7 The one, that they shut the word of the euerlasting God, almost quite out of that Seruice they pretend is done for his glorie: and bring in the authoritie of sinfull &amp; shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse men. The other, for that they giue authoritie to these bookes in time to come, which are full of incredible tales and damnable lyes, and cause them to be receiued by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, for classicall authors. The wrong they do to almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God in the former is odious, the imposture they lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Church in the other is most dangerous.</p>
               <p n="8">8 For the latter obserue what Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth in a like case, and feare the consequent that may follow thereof.<note place="margin">Breuiar. in festo Andreae.</note> The Cardinall brings a testimony out of a booke called, <hi>The passion of Saint Andrew the Apostle, written</hi> (as is pretended) <hi>by his disciples that were present at it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. de Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char. l. 2. c. 1.</note> Of which booke he saith. <hi>Hunc librum legitimum esse satis constat, That
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:177094:180"/> this booke is of credit it appeareth plainely.</hi> His profound reasons are, because he knoweth none that haue called <hi>the credit thereof into question, and that his words, Salue sancta crux, All haile holy crosse, are most famous in the Church; to let passe that in the Romane Breuiarie lately renewed and purged, the passion of Saint Andrew hath it place.</hi> No man (it may be) denied it, because it was long ere it was found, and when it was found, so contemned that no man spake of it. And <hi>Salue sancta crux</hi> may be no elder then the storie, nor the storie then it, and both of new inuention: &amp; as for the reformed Breuiarie, it is rather deformed, but only in a very few things, that could not stand with common sense. If these be reasons to proue this fables authoritie, what shall let, but that in halfe another ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, <hi>Surius the lyer,</hi> and whom you will beside shall be of as good authoritie as this? and to say truth, I thinke they be so. For beside that it smels of the Greeke heresie of the not proceeding of the holy Ghost: so it contraries the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals owne opinion,<note place="margin">Bell. de Imag. l. 2. cap. 27.</note> that wil haue Saint <hi>Andrew</hi> fastened with nailes, as Christ was. Whereas the Achaians say he was bound with ropes, and that they were present and eye wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses thereof. Neither is it improbable, but that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall had seene, or at the least he might haue seene Bishop <hi>Whites Diacosion Martyrion,</hi> who long before the Cardinall euer wrote, had branded this storie, that it was <hi>Apocryphall, absque controuersia,</hi> without all controuersie. Neither is it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, but that the Bishop finding it so fauourable vnto that cause which he defended with all his heart, and to his vtmost power, would haue salued and saued the credit thereof, if he had not great cause to the contrarie; especially he would not haue said with so strong asseueration, that it is <hi>Apocryphall without controuersie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 These are the supplies of the ancient and receiued histories of the Church: so barbarous, so absurd, so senslesse, so against nature, reason &amp; possibility, that they rather sauour the braines of mad men, then the wit and grauitie of any that had toucht with their lips the water of life,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.14. Esai 6.7.</note> or the fire taken from the Altar of God. Howbeit, I must confesse that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:177094:181"/> of our late Romanists haue ingenuously acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and boldly reproued, the absurd and grosse tales of these somewhat elder times, or corrupted authors. And I thinke, do wish in their hearts, that their elders had bene wiser, and more circumspect then they were; as appeareth by Bishop <hi>Canus</hi> and others of his ranke. Yet I cannot but hold it strange when I see a continuance, or rather not onely a small accesse, but a great increase of such fabulous writers, after such mislike as is shewed by some of their learnedest wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; such hope of reformation thereof pretended by others, that nothing is amended, but the worst that were, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their former reputation, others are added seuen times worse the children of perdition then the former were.</p>
               <p n="10">10 For the old motheaten, leaden Legend and the foisty and fenowed Festiuall, are yet secretly layd vp in corners, read with solemne deuotion, kept close with great care, sometimes in searches lost, with great griefe vnto the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as if they were the best bookes of their religion. Which daily appeareth, when among other superstitious trash, they are taken from Recusants, and are as verily beleeued by the ignorant Papists, nay I may well thinke better, then the blessed booke of God himselfe. As I haue heard of a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious ignorant woman, that when she heard the passion of Christ read in her owne tongue, she wept bitterly, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly compassioned so great outrage done to the Sonne of God. After some pause and recollection of her spirits, she asked where this was done, &amp; when: it was answered, many thousand miles hence at Ierusalem, and a great while ago, about fifteene hundred yeares. Then (quoth she) if it was so farre off, and so long ago, by the grace of God it might proue a lye, and therein she comforted her selfe. This may be but a tale, rather made by wit, then acted in deed; but certainly as absurd things as this haue bene said, and done, both by people and Priests in the darkenesse of ignorance and the night of superstition and idolatrie. For they <hi>knew not the Scriptures, nor the power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 For the best learning the most people had in the very
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:177094:181"/> letter and story of the Gospel, was when they heard <hi>per Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum Iesum Dominum nostrum,</hi> they would put off their cappes and make curtesie; or if the Priest could end his words in <hi>am</hi> and <hi>um,</hi> in <hi>ant</hi> and <hi>vnt,</hi> it was as good Latine as any in a pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter candlesticke: <hi>Some rostum, sum soddum, &amp; sum for Alison, &amp;c. per Christum Dominū nostrum.</hi> When the Priests were such asses to reade these Legends, no maruell if the people were such fooles to beleeue them. Neither may it seeme strange, seeing many of their learnedst defend many as absurd tales as any in the Legend, and make the world beleeue, that themselues hold them for truth: or at least they will conniue and winke at all that serues their turne, and let it passe <hi>pro bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Ecclesiae,</hi> that is in plaine English, for the furtherance of their cause. With which dumbe and deafe policy, which is neither to see nor heare of any deformities in the Church, they haue held the world so long bewitched with such old wiues tales, as if they were indeed true miracles, or reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations from heauen.</p>

               <p n="17">17 This desire of reformation herein, if it take not the good effect in histories past and dispersed into many hands, yet it is strange that it hath not wrought some sparke of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie in those that since haue written of old Saints or new: the powdered vp miracles and visions of elder times, or the fresh deuices of latest inuentions. In the former kind, <hi>Laur. Surius</hi> leapes ouer the bounds of all modestie, into the depth of all not onely improbabilitie, but impossibilitie. And yet his gests (which are worse then iests, as I said) are the most frequent authoritie in the Romane Breuiarie, newly defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by his and such Friers tales. <hi>Sedulius</hi> in his Conformities of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> though he came after him in time, yet hath he ouerstript him and gotten before him in detestable and abhominable lying, and may take the whetstone from him.

In whom though some things are very incredible, yet most things are such as many a good honest hearted Pastor in our Church doth. He prayed for sicke folks, whose life by their friends was despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and they recouered; so might they haply haue done without prayers. To tell these tales were but to waste time.

               <p n="10">10 If this were true, or could euer be proued, I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it were the most expedit course to end al controuersies, and to establish as constant a peace, as is held by <hi>Satan</hi> and all his diuels in hell.

For I cannot thinke that any can be so impudent a flatterer of the Pope, that will yeeld him this prerogatiue, that he can neither erre nor be deceiued in the interpretation of the Scriptures.

And therefore there is no reason to let loose that hold of proofe we haue: whereby we can directly conuince, that many of their Popes haue bene damnable he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes against the faith, most wicked of life in all their conuersation: and therefore vnfit to be Iudges sole or para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount in the Church of God.

All which duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, he was certainly the very Pope, if there were any at all. If he were the Pope, then he erred in doctrine and life, for he was deposed for both. And being deposed by the Councel, it doth ratifie the authoritie of a Councell aboue the Pope. If there was none Pope of the three, then during all that schisme, there was no ministeriall head of their Church at all, and then their Church was dead, without sense or motion;<note place="margin">Principium sensus &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus à cerebro.</note> or like Sir <hi>Iohn Mandeuils</hi> monsters, that had eyes in their shoulders, for lacke of heads.

                  <hi>as Xenophon described a good Prince vnder the name of Cyrus.</hi> This <hi>Benno</hi> was an arch-presbyter of the Romane Church, and a Cardinal of the same.

But as <hi>Xenophon</hi> described the office of a good King vnder the name of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> whose gouernment drew very neare vnto his description; so it is not like that <hi>Benno</hi> would haue taken such a name, of so good a Pope, as is pretended, &amp; that vnder his nose, in his own daies, to make him the patterne of an il Pope. That many historians commend this Pope, it is no maruell. For he was a most vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent defender of the priuiledges and honour of that Sea, which was counted the onely grace &amp; glorie of Bishops in those times, and since: as if all had bene done for the good of the Church, which indeed was for to execute their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or enlarge their dominions, or to courbe Kings, or to protect wicked Priests, or to dispose of all Church liuings, or the like profitable or pleasurable considerations.

What can Rome pleade why she might not fall from the faith, as well as other cities, other nations? They cannot plead Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Let them shew if they can, one, not onely sentence, but word, that intituleth Rome, or the Bishop thereof, to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge aboue other cities. I know nothing they haue to say for Rome, but that it was remembred by the Apostle, to haue receiued the faith, that they are commended for it, that they then kept it, that the Gospell had bene there preached by Apostolicall authoritie, &amp;c.

                  <hi>This pestilence crept in by little and little, and did secretly win ground, still continuing a long time in Rome before it was openly discouered.

One state of gouernment hath in time degenerated into another, without sound of trumpet, or clashing of armor. And yet hath bene sensibly felt, and enforced reformation.

And therefore those Romane Prelates were so farre from obtaining their purpose, that the learned Bishops in all probabilitie, of purpose made a Canon, directly to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent this presumptuous pride, and to smother this perillous monster in the birth. They made Canons quite opposite to the Popes request, taking from them not onely the practise of Appeales, but the very titles of superioritie. <hi>No man in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> might appeale <hi>ad transmarinas partes, to the parts beyond the sea:</hi> which was in plaine termes, to <hi>Rome.</hi> No man should be called,<note place="margin">Concil.

This hath bene the case of the Romane Church. Her diseases had secret (as I may call them) influences and insinuations, though felt by some, yet not attended by many. They increased to a deadly and desperate sicknesse, neglected all counsell, refused all Physicke, cast vp all cordials, whereof many a good Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or at least the best Physition of our soules might say, <hi>Curauimus Babilonem, &amp; non est sanata.</hi>

               <p n="2">2 For the breeding and increment of the disease, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter hath discouered. Now it is worth the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how that Synagogue stood like a <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> a dead
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:177094:244"/> sea, though now and then a little agitated with the tongues and pennes of a few conscionable men in their generations; yet vnmoueable in the maine, as supported and maintained by impregnable forts,<note place="margin">Gen. 11.4.</note> that menaced heauen like the tower of Babell, and could neuer be demolished but by diuine prouidence from heauen, (for who could withstand <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> of Rome that mighty hunter) when the outward face of the Chucrh spake all but the language of Rome, as if Israels tongue had bene more then halfe turned into Ashdod,<note place="margin">Nehem. 13.</note> and could not speake Scripture language. Vntill it pleased God to turne the curse into a blessing, and to discouer the hidden and almost outworne Hebrue and Greeke tongues, the originals of the Diuine Scriptures, and to open the heart of that <hi>Bezaliel</hi> or <hi>Aholiah</hi> that by Gods inspiration deuised printing,<note place="margin">Exod. 31.2.</note> by which the Gospell was dispersed into diuers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the dayes of reformation, as it was by the Apostles who spake all tongues, at the first teaching and information thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In this discourse I must distinguish times; those of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages from these present dayes. For they had not one shift to tenne, which are now found out and practised. For as in a kingdome of darknesse, there may be many a candle light, and shining, and yet the kingdome remaine darke, saue onely neare to that little light; and therefore lesse ado need to be made to preserue the darknesse. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther putting them out,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.15. Mark. 4.21.</note> or couering them vnder a bush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell, or setting them vnder a bed, would serue the turne. But when the Sun casteth forth the brightnesse of his beams, and that all darknesse beginneth to be dispersed, then the children of darknesse begin to stirre, not onely to preserue the darknesse wherein they were, by opposition to the light, but also turne light it selfe into darknesse, or would if it were possible. The state of the Romane Church had a long night of darknesse,<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.19.</note> which continued the longer because men loued darknesse more then light, <hi>For that their deeds were euill.</hi> Now and then, and here and there, there was a <hi>Beda,</hi> or a <hi>Bertram,</hi> or a <hi>Bernard,</hi> or such like Bees that offred hony, and yet did
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:177094:244"/> sting the Romane Church, for their manners, and gaue some light in some particulars with their doctrine. Others more vehement, as <hi>Iohn Wickliffe, Iohn Husse,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prage,</hi> with many others needlesse to be named, (a few lights I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, in such a kingdome of darknesse) of whom some were kept vnder with little or no preferment, that their light might not shine abroad though it did appeare to some; but others were cleane put out, their bodies aliue, or their bones being dead, were burnt to ashes.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But the Romanists in our age are like fishes in a pond, from whom the water is drained. As long as they had water at will, though it were neuer so muddy, yet they were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed well enough with their grosse element: but when the water is drawne from them, and they begin to be skanted, they leape, and they friske, and flappe with their tayles, though they are rather hurt then helped thereby. So they, as long as they liued in possession of their owne broken cisterns,<note place="margin">Ier. 2.12.</note> and enioyed the contentment of their muddy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they stirred little. But since by the warmth and Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the Gospel, their filthy ponds are almost drained, and they left to the open light, their Pope, their Cardinals, their Friars, their Iesuits, their agents of all sects and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, leape, and friske, &amp; tumble head ouer taile, from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to Court; from nation to nation:<note place="margin">Mat. 12.43.</note> like the vncleane spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that was cast forth, and sought seuen diuels worse then himselfe, that they may make the end of their Synagogue worse then the beginning.

               <p n="5">5 These latter times would aske large commentaries, to discouer and discourse of the Bishop of Romes profuse riot in this behalfe. I will in this Chapter confine my selfe vnto some few examples, wherein notwithstanding I will not say much, but that which is necessary to my present purpose.

For though they saw the light,<note place="margin">Iohn 1.9.10.</note> yet they receiued not that light that enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth euery man that hath light in this world: and therefore

This is the reason that our Sauiour saith, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist was greater then any of the Prophets, and that the least in the kingdome of God is greater then <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist. For as greater meanes were by God vouchsafed, so was more knowledge by him required. Where the meanes were lesse, God required lesse; and where the meanes are more, there more is expected, as in the disposing and employments of the talents.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.</note> If our fathers vsed one talent well, they shall haue their reward. If we haue fiue, we must not expect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment if we neglect foure, and make vse but of one. That which would serue our fathers turnes, will not serue ours. We cannot make the same plea in the day of Christ.

So doth Christ looke for in these dayes of light, that which he neuer expected in the times of darknesse. Their desires might in mercy well be accepted.

               <p n="14">14 Moreouer we know, and are sufficiently able to proue, that the very Romane religion, was not that before <hi>Luthers</hi> time, in many points fundamentall, which now it is. For as before is obserued,<note place="margin">Sup. c. 6. &amp; 10</note> the Scriptures of God were neuer refused in the triall of truth, vntill <hi>Luther</hi> had driuen the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists from any hold by them, and had confuted the most points of Popery by them. But when they saw their errors conuinced, they could neither yeeld vnto the Scriptures their deserued reuerence, nor ceasse to cauill as the Herodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Scribes, Pharises, and Saduces,<note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> when they were conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:177094:261"/> nor runne away with the diuell,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.</note> when they are by Gods word confounded. But the Scriptures, and together with them, all <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> must be not onely set aside, as a thing not necessary, but vtterly contemned and reiected as hurtfull and dangerous. Though the Scriptures in our fathers dayes were kept in silence and secrecie, yet they lost not all their honour, as now they haue in the Romane Church: which hath bene sufficiently proued. Dig downe but this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the strength of all religion faileth. And therfore in this, our modernes seeming Christians, are farre worse then their ancesters. For their fathers were ignorantly blind, they are wilfully mad. The Popes omnipotencie was neuer defended in butchering mens consciences; massacring Christians, and murthering Kings, was not so much as named in former times: but now such things are taught, perswaded and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, that not onely Christian eares should abhorre it, but we may iustly say with the Apostle in another case, they do such things euen in this particular, as are not named among the Gentiles who knew not God.

                  <q>As often as any man can, or should keepe secret any verity, by the same right it is lawfull for him to vse ambiguous and doubtfull words; which when they are deliuered by reason of their diuerse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the truth may be couered without a lye. It might be couered verily by the hearers taking of the words otherwise, or in other sence then they are deliuered by the speaker. But without a lye: because that sence which is deliuered by the speaker is also true, whereas the words are ambiguous and haue diuers sences, and all true. Neither is this kind of deceipt to be reputed a fault, or to be blamed: because he that spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the words is not bound to open the truth vnto his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but rather to hide it. Neither is he bound to speake in the sence wherein the words are commonly taken, or may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the hearers.

               <p n="17">17 In the same manner they haue dealt with many sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Fathers,<note place="margin">In eodem In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice saepiss.</note> vnder the colour of their Indices or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; when indeed they censure the very words of the text, and passages in <hi>Ferus,</hi> and other of their owne writers, which in truth are the gracious words of ancient Orthodoxe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whom they most desperatly wound through the sides of their owne fellowes and friends. Their sophisticating of Fathers in their new approued prints, their blotting out, and putting in, and corrupting of all reuerend <hi>Antiquitie,</hi> was not thought vpon in those dayes. Therefore the Fathers being more innocent in many things then their sonnes, may haue obtained the mercie of God, which may iustly be denied to those who willingly withhold the truth of God in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> vpon whom the wrath of God shall be reuealed from heauen. So that we may conclude with good reason, many of our Ancestors who liued in the dayes of Romane darknesse, might be receiued to mercy, and be saued in that visible Church, holding those former positions and conclusions, and so dying. Whereas now in the same Church, few or none can be saued, who destroy these foundations, &amp; build vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues a Babylonian tower, of all pride and presumption, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, villanie, and impietie.</p>
               <p n="18">18 We farther know, that there are twelue houres in the day of a mans life, wherein some are called at the first,<note place="margin">Math. 20.2.3.</note> some at the third, some at the sixt or ninth, some at the eleuenth houre; and yet by the mercie and bountie of that great house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder, euery one may receiue his penny.

<pb n="488" facs="tcp:177094:263"/> might despaire; yet but one, lest a wicked sinner might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume. But in case of error, out of all doubt, many a deuout Christian liuing in the former dayes of darknesse, hungring and thirsting after righteousnesse, holding the former foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,<note place="margin">Psal. 19.12.</note> and heartily begging pardon for his secret faults, (se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to himselfe, and therefore the more pardonable, but knowne to God, from whose eyes nothing is hid) may well rest vnder our hope of his saluation.

                  <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children were as chearefull and well liking when they were brought before the King, though they fed on pulse and dranke water, as they that fared deliciously with the Kings diet, yea and better too.

               <p n="19">19 Christians must liue by lawes, and not by examples. A King vpon circumstances of the fact, in discretion, or by his royall power, in his fauour may pardon some malefactors in cases for which many are worthily executed.

               <p n="20">20 Wherefore let Christians, who haue a better triall of their faith, and a more sure foundation of their hope, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer depend vpon so weake and idle a plea, as hath bene or may be, and in truth is, insisted vpon, by the Iewes, Turkes, Indians, Calecutians, and Infidels of all sorts, euen to this day. Some depend on the Law, and refuse the Gospel as the Iewes. Some worship God, and not Iesus Christ whom he hath sent, as Turkes. Some worship diuels, and are vtterly without God in this world, as many sorts of Infidels. We
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:177094:263"/> know this by the light of truth, and we seeke their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or we should with our vttermost trauels.

               <p n="21">21 Howbeit our answer of our fathers may be with great hope, yea some assurance, as hath bene proued.

But ô fooles &amp; slow of heart, that beleeue not the Scriptures,<note place="margin">Luke 24.25. Mat. 22.29.</note> and the power of God.

Neither shall the saued fathers pitie their condemned children, nor the saued children their condemned fathers, in the day of Christ, when loue shall be most inflamed in the hearts of the faithfull.

               <p n="22">22 When <hi>Abraham</hi> was called out of the idolatrous house of his fathers, was he sollicitous to aske what became of his fathers, before he yeelded his obedience vnto God?

What if a few were conuerted? The best conclusion can be made, is, It was happy for <hi>Abraham</hi> that he by faith was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. There were some very good Kings, that had as very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked parents. Should the sonnes be so propitious to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to damne themselues? So might <hi>Iosiah</hi> neuer haue rent his clothes,<note place="margin">2.

The same might be the defence of any malefactors sonne. His father was a theefe, an adulterer, a traytor, an idolater; yet some such haue bene saued: therefore he will walke in his fathers steps, lest he might seeme to condemne him. Might he not say with our Ignorants, shall I condemne my father? if he were saued, why not I? This is folish pitie, and worse presumption. What if Gods grace superabounded where mens sinnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.20.6.1. Ezech. 18.</note> shall we sinne that grace may abound?

               <p n="25">25 That which the Father hath applied vnto the faith deliuered in that Creed, (which indeed is all Catholique and orthodoxall, but is not all the Catholique and orthodoxall faith,) that the Doctor applies not onely vnto the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith, wherof many particulars are not expressed in that Creed, but vnto the Catholique Romane faith now held, as al his discourse pretendeth.

                  <q>For pardon may be granted to one that erreth of simplicitie, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of himselfe: I who at first was a blasphemer and a persecutor, and iniurious, haue now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy, because I did it ignorantly. But after inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reuelation made, he that wittingly and willingly perseuereth in that wherein he erred, sinneth without pardon of his ignorance.

                  <hi>Sed dicit aliquis, quid ergo fiet de hijs, qui in praeteritum de haeresi ad Ecclesiam venientes, sine baptismo admissi sunt?</hi>
                  <q>Some man will say, What then shall become of those who in times past returned from heresie to the Church, and were admitted without baptisme? Though this be not our aduersaries obiection in so many words, yet the answer satisfieth the question in substance for all.</q>

                  <q>Our Lord is powerfull in his mercy to giue pardon, and not to separate them from the benefits of his Church, who simply were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Church, and died therein: yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a man must not alwayes erre, because he hath once er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

The children are all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in this houshold. The husband he keepes constant in his loue, till his wife playeth the harlot; he vrgeth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and deferreth the diuorce; he departeth into another country to receiue a kingdome, taketh order for the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his wife and family vntill his returne. She continueth to play the harlot till her children espie it. They are iealous of their fathers honour, and humbly intreate reformation; as <hi>Luther</hi> did of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and a Councell to whom he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. She yet continueth in her spirituall fornications; and the more she is intreated, the more she is inflamed with inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lust,<note place="margin">Seneca.

Shall they become the mothers bawds? Shall they see her sinne, and say nothing? Shall they perceiue their fathers glory stained daily, and suffer it? This were to bring their mothers sinnes vpon their owne heads, and haue her bloud required at their hands. Her husband would be reconciled, if she would amend; her children would returne as chickens vnder her wings, if she would be reformed. This she will not do. Therefore her husband wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her a bill of diuorce, and her children worthily forsake her. They haue cause to complaine, and not she.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Examine this, and apply it to Christ the Spouse of the
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:177094:266"/> ancient Romane Church, and the head and members of her present Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy, and many of the both Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie and people that saw and long with griefe endured their leud mothers fornications and idolatries.

In which case, neither doth Gods promise faile vnto his beloued Spouse that neuer played the harlot, which is called the houshold of faith, and children of obedience, which was dispersed ouer the face of the earth: and was neuer but by vaine presumption confined vnto the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> more then to any other Church where the truth of Christs Gospell was preached and professed. There were vndoubtedly many children in house with that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious mother, which might be mercifully saued: and there might be, and certainly were many iustly condemned, &amp; that without all preiudice vnto their posteritie. How doth one <hi>Schoppius</hi> chop Logicke in this case, with an outcry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all of our Religion, as if we held there were no Church for many hundred yeares, and that therefore none could be saued in all that time? <hi>Ite nunc miseri &amp; infoelices Lutherani, &amp; magistris vestris tam absurda praecipientibus auscultate: Go to now you miserable and vnhappie Lutherans, and hearken to your mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who teach you such absurdities. If there were neuer any Church,</hi> (what a strange and monstrous supposition is this, by vs vtterly denied and condemned) <hi>then no man could be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued these fiue hundred yeares: then all Martyrs and Bishops of the Church were damned; then all Augustines and Hieromes perished: and it was false which Christ promised, that he would build his Church vpon a rocke that could not be shaken.</hi> This he.

               <p n="31">31 In censuring our ancestors, we must vse truth, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and wisedome; which well obserued, we shall hardly iudge amisse.

It is not in the censure of men: it resteth in the meere mercy of God. In this let all men be silent, and God onely speake, who onely knoweth who belong vnto him. And when all is said and done, we can reach no further then the Apostle S. <hi>Paule,</hi> who when he had diued into this depth to the very bottome, and had soared into this mysterie aboue the highest mountaine, yet found a depth whereinto he could not search, and an height whereto he could not reach.

               <p n="10">10 But if I speake of the vnlearned sort of men or women in this land, the labour of forgetting is easily saued.

They neuer attained vnto knowledge in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny religion; not in ours, and therfore they are so easily drawn away. Not in the Romane religion, wherein they are kept more ignorant, but are made withall more obstinate. For as knowledge hath no greater enemies then the ignorant, so

This maketh many liue, and to be contented to dye, in a perswasion whereof they haue no ground: a religion which they hang onely on the sleeue of him that teacheth it, or vpon such generalities wherewith the wisest may be deceiued; or by such vngranted and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged principles, that their maisters can neuer euince by any demonstration, no nor so much as perswade with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reason, but that they haue gotten credulous disciples to whom <hi>ipse dixit,</hi> their bare word, must be their best war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>

               <p n="52">52 In the new Testament our Sauiour tasted nothing but dishonour, want, and griefe; he promised no better to his Apostles; they enioyed no other while they liued; they left no order after them to aduance the Preachers of the Gospell vnto high estates.

They were vnder the rod of Gods correction, vnder the hands of wicked tyrants that did shed their bloud without pitie or mercie. Then there was no tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Pope aboue Emperour, nor Cardinals compared, if not preferred before Kings; with the residue of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Hierarchie, which our blessed Sauiour neuer taught, when by word he forbad them to be as Princes;<note place="margin">Mat. 20.26.

               <p n="53">53 Their treasures in the primitiue times were vertues, learning, and deuotion; their pleasures were paines, in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word, in labouring night and day, in patient suffering of many persecutions; yea in dying for the name of the Lord Iesus.

               <p n="55">55 When <hi>Peter</hi> warmed his hands he denied his Maister.

This hath euer bene the practise of the man of Rome, that sin full man, that man of sinne.

In which case we will not speake of the Dukes and other Nobles or Knights, which rose in armes against that Queene.

               <p n="86">86 For those popish Bishops before named, and diuers others in that famous Queenes reigne, they had faire impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, and large maintenance, some with Archbishops or Bishops, others in their owne houses, some in prisons; but all at that ease, that many a better Christian then the best of them, might then and would yet vnder the Roman tyrannie, sell all that they haue to liue as they did in all things, except
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:177094:297"/> their restraint. They held all points of the Romane faith, yet were they neuer questioned for their life.

Then lawes began to be made for preuention of the like, and suppressing of such as might kindle a new fire.</p>
               <p n="87">87 Such mulcts as haue bene imposed, haue bene gently to many remitted, in part or in whole. They who haue payd their fines haue bene well able to spare them, and to liue richly without them.

And I would know of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Recusants, that haue one part of three at the least of their liuing left vnto them, and the whole valued at so low a rate, that vpon examination it will scarce proue that the King for his two parts hath the tenth part of their liuing, perhaps not the twentieth; whether their case for all their religion, which is opposite to ours, and blasphemous against God, be not as good in the iust seueritie of our statute Lawes, (not but that all our Non-conformitants are most deseruedly punished) as the vnreformed Ministers, that hold the same religion with vs in <hi>toto,</hi> and varie but in matters of Ceremonies: who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their benefices, and iustly disenabled to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of their ministerie, if they submit not themselues to the present laudable gouernment of our Church; both receiuing chastisement, not for their opinions they hold, but for their disobedience to the State and Church; whereunto they are both refractarie. Whereby it is cleare that the penalties are not imposed for matter of religion, but for disobedience to the lawes of the land, whereunto all are obnoxious, as well
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:177094:297"/> Protestant as Papist.</p>

If in this case we compare, they indifferently enioy the Lawes of the kingdome with vs, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding our difference in opinions. And therefore haue no iust cause of complaint, that they suffer for their religion, more then others on whom the Law taketh hold, though of the established religion.

And therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the approued grammar rule, I see no cause why that which belongs vnto one thing, should not be put into the same case.

Of this kind was the couering of the Scriptures vnder the veile of an vnknowne tongue, which kept the world in ignorance; their auricular Confession that kept all men in feare, not of God, but of the Priests: their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, by which they built Monasteries, and pampred their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies: Pilgrimages, by which they enriched their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and made them powerfull.

                  <hi>when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father requireth euen such to worship him.

                  <q>Those things which are published not in the Scriptures, but onely by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, may be vnknowne without preiudice of saluation.</q> Then certainly any Christian may be saued by the reformed religion, though he know none of the Romane opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all ours is written, all or verily the most part of their religion dependeth vpon traditions vnwritten, whereof men may be ignorant without preiudice to their saluation.</p>

We affirme that as there are two wayes in our life,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.13.</note> the broad and the narrow; so are there two places after death, hell and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; this is plainly written: our aduersaries make a third and a fourth, the one to last till doomes day, that is Purgatorie, which then shall be emptied: the other <hi>Limbus puerorum,</hi> which is the place for infāts vnbaptized, &amp; for ought I know must continue for euer.

               <p n="127">127 The same may be exemplified in the Masse, in prayer for the dead, in <hi>Peters</hi> primacie, in reseruation, circumgesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and adoration of the Sacrament; in all their ceremonies

               <p n="128">128 From this position of <hi>Andradius,</hi> there arise two dangerous consequences, and fearfull to themselues and to all Christianitie. For that the Popes and the sea of Romes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, is a tradition not written, they cannot denie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that it is written they can neuer proue. Then if men had neuer knowne it, they had bene neuer the worse, and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing it, they are neuer the better.

Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, as it is, by <hi>Andradius</hi> his rule, and standeth with good reason and Scriptures; then all Popery falleth to the ground. We need no sharper axe to cut downe that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous tree, no better sluce to draine the Church from the puddle of all heresies. Yet a greater imputation of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to be layd on that Synagogue, will follow hereof: <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> saith <hi>Andradius, need not be knowne, or may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, sine dispendio salutis,</hi> without preiudice of saluation. But the Scriptures, saith his fellowes, are no Scriptures, but as we receiue them by tradition: therefore we may chuse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will euer take knowledge of the Scriptures, and yet neuerthelesse be saued. Which indeed they hold, as hath bene proued before,<note place="margin">Chap. 6.</note> to the great dishonour of almightie God, and the vtter subuersion of many a Christian soule. What shall we say to baptizing of children? to the mystery of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and other high points of faith, which some of them haue said, are not to be proued by Scriptures, but by tradition? Therefore by Romane diuinitie these may be vnknowne

               <p n="25">25 Let vs repeate, not <hi>ab ouo ad malum,</hi> from the egge to the apple; but <hi>à nido ad malum,</hi> from the very neast of the Popes infancie, to the very top of his blasphemy and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; and we shall see how either in his owne right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie, or by his forgery and vsurpation, he hath so forestal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and ingrossed all into his owne hands and power, as that no man, not endued with light and wisedome from aboue, can find either place and person, whither or to whom he may appeale. The Pope as in his owne right hath hell, Purgatory, with their members and appurtenances, or lims, if you will, both of children and fathers. We are rid of them and their inhabitants. From thence the Church was poisoned; they are worse then Scorpions, they can sting to death, but neuer cure to recouery. He claimeth all the earth both in temporall and spirituall, ciuill and Ecclesiasticall gouernment. He possesseth as much as is not ours: he entitleth himselfe to that which we enioy, as infranchised into Gods inheritance. His owne he holdeth as his vassals, vs he reputeth as his enemies; we may not be tried by him and his; he will not be iudged by vs and ours. For they are indeed our malicious and sworne ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we are their opposites and aduersaries for Christs sake: therefore neither earth nor earthly men, nor places in the aire or vnder the earth, can affoord vs either place of iudgement,
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:177094:318"/> or iust iudge in their or our perswasion.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Heauen also is vsurped by the Romane Bishop, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he pretendeth title in fee taile to himselfe, and to his heires male, though once the Salicke law was cosined in Pope <hi>Ioane.</hi> We haue heard how there he commandeth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, indenizeth and canonizeth Saints, tieth God the holy Ghost to his chaire, keepeth God the Sonne either in a boxe ouer the altar, or laking and playing with beades in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lap, or ouerruled by her importunitie, if not by her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie. He hath God the Father but his equall at most, if he be not his better; for he can bind where God looseth, and loose where God bindeth; he can make Gods truth error, and the diuels error truth. And finally, the blessed Virgin (whom I name last, as in their going procession, because they esteeme her most) I cannot admit; or at least their Lady, whom they not onely blaspheme, as is before noted, and God in her, but also make her a midwife, with the help of Angels, at the birth of an Abbesses bastard,<note place="margin">Discipulus de miraculis B. Mariae.</note> and drudge to Saint <hi>Bettrice</hi> while she wandred a whoring, and bawd to them both, while she kept their counsell, couered their sinne, smothered their shame, and preuented their punishment. Fearfull things to be spoken or thought of the Saints of God, yea the mother of God.</p>
               <p n="27">27 They haue neuer done railing vpon vs, as if we dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated from that blessed Virgine Christs mothers honour; which is most false, and with great impudencie laid to the charge of our Church. But we may say to the king of Locusts,<note place="margin">1. King. 18.17.</note> as <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet to <hi>Ahab</hi> the tyrant, <hi>Not I, but thou and thy house:</hi> It is not we, but the Pope and his syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue that trouble the seruice of God, sometime playing and dallying with the Saints, sometimes mocking them, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them, and yet most sacrilegiously dishonouring God for their sakes: and indeed sinning and shaming themselues with their open and impious idolatry and blasphemy.</p>
               <p n="28">28 May I not proceed and tender this Appeale to the blessed and glorious Trinitie? They for the most part yeeld that we are orthodoxe in the truth hereof, and we will be
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:177094:318"/> content to yeeld them their part in the same truth. Yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in haue they not left vs without scruple. For what if a Pope hath said,<note place="margin">Leo Epistola 89.</note> that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was taken in <hi>Consortium indiuiduae Trinitatis?</hi> Is it not to proue himselfe to be admitted into the same fellowship of the indiuisible Trinitie? <hi>Peter</hi> would not, the Pope should not, so blaspheme. Me thinks that the super-excellent honour of that most glorious maiestie should also be much impeached, not onely by those monstrous pictures and resemblances, mentioned in the last Chapter before, but also by giuing almost all the attributes belonging to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting Deitie, vnto their Lady; and that of mercy, euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue that God who gaue his Sonne; that God, that gaue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; that God that inspired Christs humanitie, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Father and the Sonne; one God, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to be euerlastingly glorified for euer.
